Buffy
Episode #85: Fool for Love Transcript

Written by Douglas Petrie

Prologue

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

1     EXT.   SUNNYDALE
CEMETERY- NIGHT    1

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

All is quiet in the
mist-shrouded graveyard. Suddenly, the peace is shattered as BUFFY pounds a
VAMPIRE dressed like a Van Halen reject to the ground.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

You know, it's probably none
of my business but I just gotta ask...

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

The vampire lunges at her and
she backhands it.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

You smell this bad when you
were alive?

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

She kicks the vampire into a
headstone.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

'Cause if it's a post-mortem
thing, then boy, is my face red...

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

She flips him over the
headstone and whips out a stake.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

But just so you know, the
fast-growing field of personal grooming has come a long way since you became a
vampire.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

Buffy somersaults over the
headstone, stake raised and ready to strike. But the vampire seizes her arm as
she lands, spins her around and plunges the stake into Buffy's abdomen. Her
eyes go wide with shock and pain as she looks down at the stake protruding from
her body.

ACT I

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

2     EXT.   SUNNYDALE
CEMETERY- NIGHT    2

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

Resume. Buffy looks down in
horror at the stake in her gut. She grips the shaft and, with a gasp of pain,
pulls it out. Her sweater is soaked with her blood.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

For the first time in a long
time, Buffy feels fear. She turns and flees, trying to escape the vampire. The
hunter had become the hunted. Her wound slows her, however, and she casts
terrified glances over her shoulder.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

Suddenly, the vampire leaps
in front of her and she stops with a gasp, looking around desperately for an
escape route.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

ROCKER VAMPIRE

You're going? But you were
having so much fun a minute ago!

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

Buffy brings the stake up but
the creature easily knocks it from her grasp and tosses her against a nearby
crypt. She doubles over in pain as the vampire picks up her stake and
approaches with a predatory grin.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

Buffy is helpless. She
realizes that this is the moment she's been dreading but always knew would
come. She's going to die.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

As the vampire raises the
stake for the killing blow, he's suddenly tackled to the ground by RILEY. He
rains blows down on the demon and takes out a taser but the vampire knocks it
from his hand before he can use it and takes off across the graveyard. Riley is
about to give chase when he notices Buffy's obvious distress and rushes to her
aid.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

RILEY

Buffy! What happened?

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

She holds up her bloody
hands, then collapses in arms, unconscious.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

CUT TO:

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

3     INT.   SUMMERS HOME-
BUFFY'S ROOM- DAY    3

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

Riley is applying first aid
and dressing Buffy's wound.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

I can't believe I passed out.
Do you think I'm a total wuss now?

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

RILEY

Oh, yeah. I like a girl who
can play a few hard sets of tennis with a major stab wound.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

You said it wasn't that bad.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

RILEY

I said I've seen worse.
There's a difference.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

Well, at least no major
organs got kebabed.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

RILEY

I still think you need to see
a real doctor.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

That would put me in a real
hospital which would get my real mom real freaked out. I can't do it. Don't
worry. Accelerated healing powers come with the Slayer package. And the
boyfriend who comes complete with combat medical training? That's just a Buffy
Summers bonus.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

RILEY

So tell me about the bad guy-
or guys. What do you think they were?

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

Vampire.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

RILEY

How many?

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

One.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

Riley is surprised.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

RILEY

So... what? He was like a
super-vampire or something?

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

No, he was the regular kind.
He just beat me.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

RILEY

That ever happen before?

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

I'm in the best physical
shape of my life. I mean, if you're asking how it happened, I don't-

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

The door flies open and DAWN
runs in.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

Dawn!

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

DAWN

Sorry to interrupt the
sex-capades. I just wanted to tell you that Mom's coming.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

Riley hides the bandages and
tape just as JOYCE enters the room.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

JOYCE

Hi, Riley.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

RILEY

Hey, Mrs. Summers. How're you
feeling?

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

JOYCE

I'm fine, bordering on
chipper and tomorrow planning on being obnoxious.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

RILEY

(smiles)

Glad to hear it.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

JOYCE

Buffy, when you have a minute
I'd like to go over the grocery list for next week.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

You got it.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

JOYCE

(re: alcohol)

Are you disinfecting
something?

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

Huh? Oh, uh-

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

DAWN

Mine! Some nail polish
experiments are doomed before they even begin.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

JOYCE

But you keep pushing the
envelope, honey.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

Joyce smiles and leaves,
closing the bedroom door behind her.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

DAWN

(smiles; to Buffy)

Did I just pull a
Slayer-related Mom cover-up thing? Come on, who's the man?

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

You are. A very short,
annoying man.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

Stung, Dawn's smile fades.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

If I show you something, you
promise you won't tell?

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

Dawn crosses her heart and
Buffy lifts her shirt to reveal the bandaged stab wound. Dawn is awed.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

DAWN

Oh, cool! (off Buffy's look)
I mean, gross!

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

And Mom cannot know. Okay?
You'll help me with the household stuff?

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

DAWN

Oh, sure. I save your butt
and you dump all your chores on me. (off Buffy's look) I got it. You're
covered. We're good. Just lucky it's not bikini season.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

Buffy smiles and strokes
Dawn's hair.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

RILEY

So Dawn takes household duty.
I'll take tonight's patrol.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

By yourself?

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

RILEY

Just a sweep.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

Do me a favor? Will you take
the gang along with?

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

RILEY

Okay. I will patrol with the
group tonight.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

DAWN

When do I get to patrol?

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

Not until you're never.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

4     EXT.   SUNNYDALE
CEMETERY- NIGHT    4

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

Riley moves stealthily among
the headstones, ducking from shadow to shadow. He pauses behind a large marble
slab and raises his arm, fist closed, and pumps it up and down twice before
moving further into the cemetery.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

WILLOW, ANYA and XANDER
follow about twenty yards behind him, munching potato chips and making no
effort to conceal themselves.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

XANDER

(to Willow)

What's with the hand move?
Does that like mean something?

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

WILLOW

It's code. I think it breaks
down to "choo-choo".

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

She mimics pulling a train
whistle.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

ANYA

It means to follow him. That,
or wait here for him.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

They watch Riley's covert
movements for a moment, then Willow turns to Xander.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

WILLOW

Ask.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

XANDER

(yells)

Hey, Riley! What's the (hand
gesture) all about?

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

RILEY

(exasperated)

It means yell real loud so
the vampires who don't know we're coming will have a sporting chance.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

XANDER

(to Willow)

See, now he's all mean and
sarcastic.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

WILLOW

That's because you were doing
all the yelling, Mr. Stealthy-Pants.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

ANYA

(to Riley)

It's their fault.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

RILEY

Guys, I'm thinking if we
split up, we could cover more ground. Tell you what? I'll take the cemeteries,
you guys get the Bronze.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

ANYA

Are we not being covert
enough?

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

XANDER

We're sorry!

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

WILLOW

Sorry.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

XANDER

We'll be sneakier. Promise.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

He munches loudly on a
handful of chips.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

RILEY

Okay. Just ditch the chips
and watch my back.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

WILLOW

Done.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

She reaches into the bag and
grabs a handful of chips herself before setting the bag down. Riley moves off
into the cemetery again.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

XANDER

(to Anya)

You know what he's like? He's
like a cat. You know, a big jungle cat. How come I'm not like that? It's just
so cool.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

WILLOW

(munching)

I think you're cool.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

CUT TO:

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

5     INT.   THE MAGIC BOX-
NIGHT   5

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

The reading table is piled
high with books. GILES and Buffy are into some deep research.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

GILES

Here's another one. Early
18th Century Slayer.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

Buffy closes her book with a
sigh and sets it on the stack.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

Good. Let's hope she'll be
more helpful than this last one.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

GILES

Why? What does it say?

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

Same as all the others.
Slayer called... blah, blah... great protector... blah, blah... scary
battles... blah, blah... oops! She's dead. Where are the details?

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

GILES

Details? Well, it says this
Slayer forged her own weapons.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

He hands the book to Buffy.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

Gotta love a gal with an
anvil. But where are the details of the Slayer's last battle? You know, what
made that fight special? Why did she lose?

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

GILES

You didn't lose last night,
Buffy. You just-

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

Got really close. I slipped
up, Giles. I've been training harder than ever and still I... (beat) And
there's nothing in any of these books to help me understand why. I mean... look,
I realize that every Slayer comes with an expiration mark on the package. But I
want mine to be a long time from now. Like a Cheeto. If there were just a few
good descriptions of what took out the other Slayers, maybe it would help me to
understand my mistake, to keep it from happening again.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

GILES

Yes, well, the problem is
after a final battle, it's difficult to get any... well, the Slayer's not...
she's rather...

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

It's okay to use the D-word,
Giles.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

GILES

Dead. And hence not very
forthcoming.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

Why didn't the Watchers keep
fuller accounts of it? The journals just stop.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

GILES

Well, I suppose if they're
anything like me, they just find the whole subject too-

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

Unseemly? Damn. Love ya but
you Watchers are such prigs sometimes.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

GILES

Painful... I was going to
say.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

Buffy and Giles share a
meaningful look.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

GILES

But you're right. Accounts of
the final battles would be very helpful. But there's no one left to tell the
tales.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

Buffy has a sudden revelation.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

GILES

What?

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

CUT TO:

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

6     INT.   SPIKE'S CRYPT-
NIGHT   6

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

Buffy shoves SPIKE against
the wall and holds him there.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

Ow! (beat) Wait. Not ow. You
feeling all right, Slayer? This stuff usually hurts.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

Buffy spins him around to
face her.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

Don't even start, Spike.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

What do you want?

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

Slayers. You killed two of
them.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

(wary)

I did.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

You're gonna show me how.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

FADE OUT

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

ACT II

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

7     INT.   THE BRONZE- NIGHT      7

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

Spike and Buffy sit at a
corner table. Spike greedily drains a mug of beer while Buffy stoically
watches.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

You know, there quite a few
American beers that are highly underrated. This unfortunately is not one of
them.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

Update, Spike. We're not here
to discuss the fine choice of hops. It's about two Slayers: one in China during
the Boxer Rebellion, one in New York.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

She holds up a wad of cash
and snatches it back as he tries to grab for it.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

Both got killed by you. Tell
the tale, you get the cash.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

Right. You want to learn all
about how I bested the Slayers and you want to learn fast. Right, then. We
fought. I won. The end. Pay up.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

That's not what I-

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

What did you want, eh? A
quick demo? A blow-for-blow description you can map out and memorize? It's not
about the moves, love. And since I agreed to your little proposition, we can do
this my way. Wings.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

What?

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

Spicy buffalo wings. Order me
up a plate. I'm feelin' peckish.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

Buffy sighs and turns to
signal a waitress.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

Excuse me-

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

The movement aggravates her
injury and she winces in pain.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

As I thought. Some nasty
thing got a taste of you.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

Don't get all excited. I'm
fine.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

Oh, right. Stuck in a dark
corner with a creature you loathe, diggin' up past uglies, 'cause you're fine.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

Just tell me what I want to
know.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

I told you. No one's
narrating on an empty stomach here.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

Buffy shakes her head in
exasperation.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

Were you born this big a pain
in the ass?

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

What can I tell you, baby?
I've always been bad.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

CUT TO:

8     INT.   LONDON (1880)-
VICTORIAN PARLOR- NIGHT   8

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

A very different Spike is
sitting and composing poetry off in the corner of a dinner party. The spirited
laughter of the party-goers can be heard in the background. Spike's hair is
long and unruly and he's dressed as a proper gentleman, complete with tie and
reading spectacles. He's awkward and bookish- none of the confident swagger
we're used to.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

(to himself)

Luminous... oh, no, no, no.
Irradiant's better.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

A WAITER approaches and holds
out a tray.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

WAITER

Care for an hors d'oeuvre,
sir?

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

Oh, quickly! I'm the very
spirit of vexation. What's another word for "gleaming"? It's a
perfectly perfect word as many words go but the bother is nothing rhymes, you
see.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

The waiter smiles
patronizingly and moves off into the crowd. Spike's eyes are drawn to CECILY,
young woman just entering the party.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

Cecily...

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

He turns back to his poem
with renewed purpose and jots down several more lines, then gets up and moves
through the crowd toward her.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

TITLE CARD: London, 1880

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

CUT TO:

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

A group of young ARISTOCRATs-
a woman and her two male companions- are gathered, discussing current events.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

ARISTOCRAT #1

I mean to point out that it's
something of a mystery and the police should keep an open mind.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

One of the men turns to Spike
as he passes by.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

ARISTOCRAT #2

(to Spike)

Ah, William! Favor us with
your opinion. What do you make of this rash of disappearances sweeping through
our town? Animals or thieves?

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

(haughty)

I prefer not to think of such
dark, ugly business at all. That's what the police are for. (looks at Cecily) I
prefer placing my energies into creating things of beauty.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

The third aristocrat snatches
the poem from Spike's hands.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

ARISTOCRAT #3

I see. Well, don't withhold,
William.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

ARISTOCRAT #1

Rescue us from a dreary
topic.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

(to Aristocrat #3)

Careful. The inks are still
wet. Please, it's not finished.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

ARISTOCRAT #3

Don't be shy. (reads)
"My heart expands/'tis grown a bulge in it/inspired by your beauty,
effulgent." (laughs) Effulgent?

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

Everyone laughs, mocking
Spike. Uncomfortable, Cecily glances at Spike and walks off. Spike shoots
Aristocrat #3 a sour look, snatches back his poem, and follows her.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

ARISTOCRAT #2

And that's actually one of
his better compositions.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

ARISTOCRAT #1

Have you heard? They call him
William the Bloody because of his bloody awful poetry!

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

ARISTOCRAT #3

It suits him. I'd rather have
a railroad spike through my head than listen to that awful stuff!

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

CUT TO:

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

Spike approaches Cecily who
is sitting on a sofa, away from the main party, and looking out the window.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

Cecily?

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

She turns and sighs when she
sees him.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

CECILY

Oh. Leave me alone.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

(re: other guests)

Oh, they're vulgarians.
They're not like you and I.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

CECILY

You and I? I'm going to ask
you a very personal question and I demand an honest answer. Do you understand?

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

He nods.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

CECILY

Your poetry, it's...
they're... not written about me, are they?

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

They're about how I feel.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

CECILY

Yes, but are they about me?

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

Every syllable.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

CECILY

Oh, God!

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

Oh, I know... it's sudden
and... please, if they're no good, they're only words but... the feeling behind
them... I love you, Cecily.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

CECILY

Please stop!

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

the same bloody question that haunts you: is today the day I die?

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

He brings the pool cue down
in a vicious arc and Buffy counter-attacks, enraged.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

Spike cracks the Slayer
across the face with the metal rail, sending her reeling to the floor and
pounds her repeatedly with it.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

(v.o.)

Death is on your heels, baby,
and sooner or later it's gonna catch you.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

Spike brings the rail down
for another blow but the Slayer catches it and slams it back into his face.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

(to Buffy)

And part of you wants it...
not only to stop the fear and uncertainty, but because you're just a little bit
in love with it.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

Buffy has heard enough. She
backhands Spike across the face.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

On the subway, Spike falls to
the floor and the Slayer jumps on his chest, straddling him. She pounds him
repeatedly in the face as the train car's lights go out. When they come back
on, the Slayer is on her back with Spike straddling her, his hands around her
throat.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

Death is your art. You make
it with your hands, day after day.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

Buffy stares at him, her face
a blank mask.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

The Slayer struggles beneath
Spike.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

That final gasp. That look of
peace. Part of you is desperate to know: What's it like? Where does it lead
you? And now you see, that's the secret. Not the punch you didn't throw or the
kicks you didn't land. Every Slayer... has a death wish.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

Spike grips the Slayer's head
between his hands and twists violently, snapping her neck and killing her.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

(to Buffy)

Even you.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

Spike stands up and faces
Buffy.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

In the subway, he walks to
the end of the car and pulls the emergency cord. As the train grinds to a halt,
he returns to the dead Slayer and pulls off her black leather coat.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

The only reason you've lasted
as long as you have is you've got ties to the world... your mum, your brat kid
sister, the Scoobies. They all tie you here but you're just putting off the
inevitable.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

Spike shrugs into the
Slayer's coat.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

Sooner or later, you're gonna
want it. And the second- the second- that happens...

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

Spike claps his hands
together inches from Buffy's face.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

END INTERCUT

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

You know I'll be there. I'll
slip in... have myself a real good day.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

He stares intently into
Buffy's eyes, then steps back.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

Here endeth the lesson. I
just wonder if you'll like it as much as she did.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

(cold)

Get out of my sight. Now.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

Oh... did I scare ya? You're
the Slayer. Do something about it. Hit me. Come on. One good swing. You know
you want to.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

I mean it.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

So do I. Give it me good,
Buffy. Do it!

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

The tension is rising between
them.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

Spike...

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

His passion aroused, Spike
leans in to kiss her. She backs away in horror.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

What the hell are you doing?

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

He grabs Buffy by the arms,
his words coming in a breathless pant.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

Come on. I can feel it,
Slayer. You know you want to dance.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

Say it's true. Say I do want
to.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

She shoves him to the ground
and looks down at him with disgust.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

It wouldn't be you, Spike. It
would never be you.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

She tosses the wad of cash at
him contemptuously.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

You're beneath me.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

Buffy turns and walks off
into the night, leaving Spike alone in the dark alley.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

He begins to gather up the
money, stifling a sob. As Buffy's words ring down through the years, he becomes
the same spurned and awkward young man he once was. Her words have hurt him
more than her blows ever have. He closes his eyes in anguish, takes a deep
breath, and when he looks up again, only murderous hate remains.

HARMONY

Spike, what are you doing?

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

(to himself)

Beneath me... I'll show her.

He takes out a
double-barreled shotgun, cracks the breech and loads two rounds.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

Put her six bloody feet
beneath me. Hasn't got a death wish? Bitch won't need one.

Spike is gathering up his
things, preparing to go after Buffy. Harmony is worried for him.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

HARMONY

Okay, I'm trying to be
supportive here so don't drive a stake through my heart like last time, but you
can't kill Buffy. She's the Slayer. She is so gonna kick your ass.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

I've got two barrels here
that'll prove you wrong.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

HARMONY

I knew you'd take this
personally. You are so sensitive! How are you going to kill her? Think! The
second you even point that thing at her, you're gonna be all ahhh!

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

She holds her hand to her
head in mock pain.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

HARMONY

And then you'll get
bitch-slapped up and down Main Street unless she's had enough and just stakes
you!

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

Sure, it'll hurt like hell
for about two hours...

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

He grabs Harmony by the neck
and twists. She gasps in pain.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

But she'll be dead just a little
longer than that.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

He tosses Harmony aside and
runs out.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

HARMONY

Fine! But don't come crying
to me when you fail. You couldn't kill her before you got the chip. You had
plenty of chances!

Why can't you kill her?

I haven't said a word about
the bloody Slayer since we left California. She's on the other side of the

DRUSILLA

But you're lying! I can still
see her floating all around you, laughing. Why? Why won't you push her away?

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

But I did, pet. I did it for
you. You keep punishing me. Carrying on with creatures like this.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

Pull back to reveal a CHAOS
DEMON standing nearby, holding a beer. He's tall with antlers that drip and
ooze.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

CHAOS DEMON

Okay, you guys obviously have
a thing going on here.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

DRUSILLA

I have to find my pleasures, Spike.
You taste like ashes.

SPIKE

(re: demon)

So this is my fault now?

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

CHAOS DEMON

(to Spike)

I didn't know she was seeing
somebody. (off Spike's look) I should take off.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

SPIKE

Yeah, why don't you do that?

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

The demon blows a kiss to
Drusilla, then walks off.

You can't blame the ghoul,

Oh, great. Thanks, hon.

Are you okay?

I'm fine. Have you seen my

BUFFY

Did you look under the sink?

Joyce realizes that's where
it is and goes to retrieve it.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

Where are you going?

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

JOYCE

Oh, I was hoping to put this
off but... you know the nothing that I've been dealing with the last couple of
weeks? It might not be nothing.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

BUFFY

What is it?

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

JOYCE

I'm staying overnight at the
hospital for observation. I'm getting a CAT scan.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

Buffy doesn't know what to
say. Joyce is quick to reassure her.

[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

JOYCE

It's only one night and they
say even if there is something, it's still very early if they didn't see it
before. I'm going to be fine.

Spike watches her from the
bushes, then moves forward, striding purposefully toward her, gun at his side.
He raises the gun and cocks it.

Buffy looks up at the sound,
her face wet with tears.

What do you want now?

Spike is about to pull the

What's wrong?

I don't want to talk about
it.

her.

Spike sits down next to her

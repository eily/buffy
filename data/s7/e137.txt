  RECAP: (Skip Recap...)
  GILES (V.O.)
    Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:
  1     EXT.     CITY 
    STREET IN ISTANBUL, TURKEY - NIGHT
    A dark-haired girl is held down by two hooded figures, as a third figure raises 
    an arched, shiny, silver dagger and thrusts down at her.
  Cut to:
  2     INT.     DINING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    A magical explosion occurs. Red light surrounds Willow then enters her body 
    through her nostrils. She throws her head back and a demonic apparition (huge, 
    with two horns on its head and glowy red eyes) escapes her mouth, lunging 
    toward Buffy. 
  Cut to:
  3     INT.     DINING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Buffy walks in, and everyone turns to look.
BUFFY
  (solemn) Evil. (resolute) They want an apocalypse? Oh, we'll give 'em one. 'Cause 
  we just became an army. 
  Cut to:
  4     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Anya and Dawn are sitting on the couch. Xander's sitting in a cushy chair, 
    propping his feet up on the coffee table. Andrew's sitting on the floor between 
    Xander and the fireplace.
ANYA
  Look, I'm not saying it's a happy scenario, but we're dealing with a big bad 
  that can be any dead person it wants. 
  Cut to:
  5     INT.     KITCHEN 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Andrew's backed into a corner by the new microwave talking to Jonathan/First.
ANDREW
  What do you want from me, Jonathan slash The First?
  JONATHAN/FIRST
  I have an assignment for you.
ANDREW
  You want me to hurt the girls?
  JONATHAN/FIRST
  The girls must die.
  Cut to:
  6     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    HOUSE - DAY
    Buffy opens the front door to leave, but sees Giles standing there on her 
    front porch when she opens it. Buffy goes to hug Giles, but is cut off when 
    three girls she's never met walk right into her house.
  MOLLY
  (in a Cockney British accent) Nice place. Bit of a mess. (walks inside the house)
  Cut to:
  7     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Dawn's standing in front of the three girls Giles brought with him. The three 
    girls are lined up against the wall, and Dawn's inspecting them, arms crossed 
    in front of her. 
DAWN
  They're all slayers?
GILES
  Potential slayers. Waiting for one to be called. There were many more like them 
  all over the world, but, um, now there's just a handful, and they're all on 
  their way to Sunnydale.
  Cut to:
  8     EXT.     SUNNYDALE 
    BUS STATION - NIGHT
    A charter bus opens its doors, and a couple of people walk down the steps 
    to exit the vehicle. The last person to exit is a young African-American girl, 
    wearing denim overalls and carrying a backpack. She looks around.
  Cut to:
  9     INT.     WILLOW'S 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Willow walks into her bedroom, Kennedy waits at the door. The mood is very 
    awkward.
WILLOW
  Glad we talked. 
KENNEDY
  In the spirit of air clearing...
WILLOW
  Yeah?
KENNEDY
  I feel like I need to be honest about something.
  Kennedy kisses Willow slowly, passionately.
  Cut to:
  10     INT.     UNDERGROUND 
    CAVE - NIGHT
    Still shackled to the rocky cave wall, Spike sees someone walking toward him. 
    Buffy approaches him slowly and cuts him loose of his tethers. He collapses 
    forward and braces himself with his hand on her shoulder. When he touches 
    her and realizes she's real, he smiles and squints, searching her face intently. 
    She looks into his eyes, tapping an emotional connection between them.
  BUFFY (V.O.)
  (turns to face Giles) Spike has a soul now. That's what's gonna stop him from 
  hurting people.
  Cut to:
  11     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Giles comes into Buffy's room to talk to her.
GILES
  Buffy...
BUFFY
  He can be a good man, Giles. I feel it. 
  Cut to:
  12     EXT.     ALLEY 
    IN SUNNYDALE - NIGHT
    Buffy realizes that Principal Wood is also fighting off vampires. Without 
    her help. Principal Wood overpowers one of the vampires and stakes him. Then 
    knocks the last one to the ground, staking him too. He flips the stake in 
    his hand, then returns it to his belt holster as he walks back to Buffy. 
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  I guess we should talk.
  Cut to:
  13     INT.     ROMANTIC 
    FRENCH RESTAURANT - NIGHT
    Buffy and Principal Wood are sitting across from each other at a small table 
    in a very elegant, romantic restaurant.
BUFFY
  How? How do you know about slayers?
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  My mother was one. She was killed when I was four. 
BUFFY
  (nervously) Um, something got her... a demon—?
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  A vampire. 
  Cut to:
  14     INT.     PRINCIPAL 
    WOOD'S CAR - NIGHT
    Principal Wood is driving the car, with Buffy as passenger and Spike in the 
    back seat. Buffy's very tense and uncomfortable looking, and Spike's crouched 
    down in the corner of the back seat.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  So, how do you two know each other?
BUFFY
  (answering too fast) He works with me. Uh, you know, in the struggle against 
  evil.
  Cut to:
  15     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT
    Buffy and Lissa are fighting when Spike enters the room. Lissa starts whaling 
    on Spike. She kicks Buffy away, knocking her to the ground. She pushes Spike 
    down and starts strangling him, bringing forth Spike's vampire facade. Principal 
    Wood sees Spike's face change.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  He's a vampire.
  Cut to:
  16     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Buffy's sitting on the couch alone in the living room. Spike walks in and 
    sits next to her.
SPIKE
  I should move out. 
BUFFY
  No, you have to stay.
SPIKE
  You've got another demon fighter now.
BUFFY
  That's not why I need you here.
SPIKE
  Why's that then?
BUFFY
  'Cause I'm not ready for you to not be here.
  Cut to:
  17     INT.     BATHROOM 
    AT PRINCIPAL WOOD'S PLACE - NIGHT
    Principal Wood is talking to the First in the form of his mother.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  You're not my mother.
  NIKKI/FIRST
  Would you like to know who killed me? (Principal Wood stops in his tracks) You 
  met him. You know him. You fought at his side.
  FLASHBACK: A very punk Spike is fighting with a young black woman in a New 
    York subway car. He overpowers her, and, straddling her on the floor, he breaks 
    her neck. Then he takes her leather duster and puts it on. (from episode 5x07 
    "Fool For Love")
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Spike.
  Fade to black.

    The Start Of Episode
  
  PROLOGUE:
  18     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Buffy's walking around the house, checking on the slayers-in-training as they 
    sleep—the floor is crowded with them in their sleeping bags. Buffy bends 
    down to pick up a large, thick book labeled "Greek," and she puts 
    it on the desk before turning out the light. 
  Cut to:
  19     INT.     UPSTAIRS 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Buffy goes upstairs to check on more potentials in Willow's room. Kennedy's 
    sleeping in the bed with Willow, and several more girls are in sleeping bags 
    on the floor. Buffy hears crying from the hallway, and goes to investigate. 
    In the corner at the end of the hall, Chloe is sitting on the floor, huddled 
    up with her knees to her chest, sobbing.
BUFFY
  Chloe? It is Chloe, right?
  Chloe looks up at Buffy, but before she can answer, the First Slayer tackles 
    Buffy from the side, pushing her down the stairs. The First Slayer lands on 
    top of Buffy.
  FIRST SLAYER
  (snarling, raspy) It's not enough.
  Cut to:
  20     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Buffy gasps as she wakes from the dream, alarmed. She looks around the room 
    and sees the girls are there and safe. She furrows her brow as she contemplates 
    what just happened.

  Opening Credits.
  ACT I:
  21     EXT.     ALLEY 
    IN SUNNYDALE - NIGHT
    Anya and Spike are walking together down an alley side by side.
ANYA
  I'm a bright girl, good education, quick on the uptake. So, tell me, why in 
  the name of almighty Grothnar would I let myself become human again?
SPIKE
  You're really talking to the wrong fella.
ANYA
  I mean, sure, the vengeance demon gig has some downsides...
SPIKE
  All jobs do.
ANYA
  But being human? Ugh! You're always icky on the inside, disgusting on the outside.
SPIKE
  (stops, turns to look at her) Your outside's not so bad.
ANYA
  (blushes) You know, the only thing worse than being human is being trapped inside 
  a house full of humans.
SPIKE
  Preaching to the choir, luv.
ANYA
  I mean, it's like we live in slayer central. I swear, if Buffy rooms or boards 
  one more of the potential girls, I'm gonna call a—I'm gonna call a health inspector.
SPIKE
  I like my plan better. Get up, get out, get drunk. Repeat as needed. It's just 
  more elegant. (starts walking again)
ANYA
  (puts her arm through his) Thanks for having me along.
SPIKE
  (looks at Anya's arm through his) Don't mention it.
ANYA
  At first, I thought... it's weird. Is Spike asking me out on a date? 'Cause 
  that would just be...(unlaces her arm from his) nuts. (laughs nervously) 
SPIKE
  Right. I'm just out for the alcohol.
ANYA
  Right there with you, scooter. (puts her hands in her pockets) Tonight, I plan 
  to drink you under the table.
SPIKE
  You're on, then.
ANYA
  Good. (shrugs) Of course, once you're down there, I could join you. Kidding. 
  I like my sex on top of the table.
SPIKE
  (looks up to the sky) Would you let it go? You're like a dog with a bone!
ANYA
  So what?
SPIKE
  It's my bone. Just drop it.
ANYA
  OK. OK. I wasn't proposing. Time goes by, girl gets hungry. You should know.
SPIKE
  (rolls his eyes) Oh, thank God.
ANYA
  What?
SPIKE
  Demon.
ANYA
  (with a demon standing behind her) Huh?
DEMON
  (pushing Anya to the ground) D'Hoffryn says you die.
SPIKE
  Of course he does.
  Spike kicks the demon between the legs, causing it to double over. Then 
    Spike punches it in the head, knocking the demon to the ground. Spike looks 
    at Anya, then back at the demon, and decides to flee the scene. He grabs Anya 
    by the arm, pulling her hastily to her feet.
ANYA
  Oh, hey!
  Spike and Anya run down the alley, away from the demon.
  Cut to:
  22     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    CUBICLE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    Buffy's sitting at her desk, and Principal Wood's standing behind her with 
    his arms crossed. They are both facing the same direction.
BUFFY
  This may mean more than you think.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Is that so? 
  Show that Principal Wood and Buffy are talking to two young boys who have 
    bruises and ripped shirts.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Because I think what we have here is a couple of chuckle-heads who thought that 
  a cafeteria fist fight would impress. I'm not impressed. Buffy, are you impressed? 
  (Buffy purses her lips and shakes her head disapprovingly) Still, I'm gonna 
  cut you guys some slack this time. (makes a gesture toward the door with his 
  thumb; the kids leave; to Buffy) Third fight this week, and it's just getting 
  worse. (closes window blinds, walks to the front of Buffy's desk) Plus, a rise 
  in vandalism. Three students missing. Tell me something, Buffy, in your professional 
  opinion— (listens to the kids rough-housing in the hallway outside) it's started, 
  hasn't it? (closes another set of window blinds)
BUFFY
  The hellmouth has begun its semi-annual percolation. Usually, it blows around 
  May.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Was it like this before? I mean, it just seems to me as if things are getting 
  bad faster than we thought.
BUFFY
  We're a little ahead of schedule.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  I can't say I'm too surprised. I knew I signed on for something, but, Buffy, 
  I'm just a guy. Granted, a cool and sexy vampire-fighting guy, but still.
BUFFY
  (smiles) Don't forget "snappy dresser."
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  (smiles) Mm. Thank you. But this is gonna get bigger than me.
BUFFY
  Yeah, it is.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  That's why I've decided to give you this.
  Principal Wood reaches down under Buffy's desk and pulls up a large leather 
    duffel bag, setting it on her desk with a clunk.
BUFFY
  What is it?
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  An emergency kit. This bag belonged to my mother.
BUFFY
  A slayer keepsake. I-I couldn't.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Well, you have to. Technically, it should have been passed down directly to 
  you through the years, but after my mother died... I guess I just couldn't part 
  with it.
BUFFY
  Wow!
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  I don't know what's inside, exactly, but I know it has something to do with 
  her power. Well, your power now.
BUFFY
  I-I don't know what to say.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Try saying, "Thank you, Principal Wood."
BUFFY
  Thank you, Principal Wood.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  (grins) Ah, call me Robin. Now, I'd like to see where you work.
BUFFY
  Uh, here, actually. (touches her desk) Uh, th-this is my desk, and, uh, (holds 
  up her pencil holder) these are my pencils...
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  No, where you do your other work.
  Cut to:
  23     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Buffy and Principal Wood walk through the front door to Buffy's house.
BUFFY
  So, all the potential slayers—who seem to keep popping up from, like, every 
  corner of the earth— (shuts the door) were getting killed.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  By the First.
BUFFY
  Agents of. We thought the Council could protect them, but, unfortunately, no 
  one was protecting the Council, and all their watchers were killed. Word got 
  out, and they've all been coming here since.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Well, there's nothing like the end of the world to bring people together. 
BUFFY
  It's heartwarming. Anyway, this is, uh, it. Command central.
ANDREW
  (storms into the room wearing a white apron and a red and white checked oven 
  mitt on each hand) Where the hell have you been? (crosses arms) This funnel 
  cake is kicking my ass.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Yeah, I hear they're tricky.
BUFFY
  Robin Wood, this is...Andrew.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  (offers his hand) It's a pleasure. (shakes hands with Andrew)
BUFFY
  Andrew is our—actually, he's our hostage.
ANDREW
  I like to think of myself more as a (makes quote marks in the air with his mitted 
  hands) "guestage."
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  (to Buffy) So, you—you hold him here against his will?
BUFFY
  Well, he was evil, and people got killed, and now he...bakes. It's a thing.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Oh.
ANDREW
  Could we try to just keep our secret headquarters a little bit secret? Keep 
  bringing people in, they're gonna see everything. They'll see the big board.
BUFFY
  Andrew, we don't have a big board.
ANDREW
  (runs to fetch a white dry-erase board from behind the chair) I, uh, made it 
  myself.
  The board is approximately 2' x 4', and is labeled: SUNNYDALE "BIG 
    BOARD". Using every color of marker, the board features a hand-drawn 
    map of Sunnydale, with representations of trees, cemeteries, railroad tracks, 
    and the street grid.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Oh, I wouldn't have guessed.
ANDREW
  (pointing to the board) Uh, this is us. And this represents the First in various 
  incarnations. And, uh, there's no pattern to the naked eye yet, but the instant 
  one emerges, yours truly is on it. (Buffy and Wood look at each other, then 
  walk away; Andrew calls after them) Where do we put our receipts?
  Cut to:
  24     EXT.     BACKYARD 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Buffy leads Principal Wood out to the back porch.
BUFFY
  You'll have to forgive Andrew. Or not. Your call. We do have a lot more working 
  for us than just the, uh, big board.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  So, I see.
  Pan out to show that the potential slayers are training in the backyard, 
    being led by Kennedy.
POTENTIALS
  Huh!
KENNEDY
  (hands on her hips) Punch block combo!
POTENTIALS
  Huh!
KENNEDY
  Cross block kick!
POTENTIALS
  Huh!
KENNEDY
  Chamber your energy. Punch block combo! (Chloe does the moves incorrectly, and 
  Kennedy notices, walking up to her) Hold it! What the hell do you call that, 
  potential? Try that in the field, you are dead. Drop, and give me 20.
  CHLOE
  20 what?
KENNEDY
  (in her face) Push-ups, maggot! (Chloe drops to do push-ups; Kennedy turns toward 
  Buffy and Wood, still scowling, then suddenly grinning and giddy) I love this 
  job! Did you see that? I called that girl "maggot." (to Wood) Hi. 
  (hands on her hips again) Who the hell are you?
BUFFY
  An ally.
KENNEDY
  So, what do you think? My girls ready to kick some ass, or what?
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Looking strong.
KENNEDY
  But...?
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Well, I'm just not sure the First has an ass that you can actually, you know, 
  kick.
KENNEDY
  (smirks) Guess we'll see.
AMANDA
  (waving) Principal Wood, hi! It's so weird seeing you outside of school.
KENNEDY
  (to Amanda) What are you waving at, potential? Attention!
POTENTIALS
  Huh!
KENNEDY
  Rising sun. Begin. (they continue their training as Buffy and Wood talk)
BUFFY
  You're right, it's not enough.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  That's not what I said, Buffy. It's an impressive group of recruits.
BUFFY
  They're not recruits. Recruits are...recruited. These girls were chosen. 
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  You're doing the best you can with what you've got.
BUFFY
  They're not all gonna make it. Some will die, and nothing I can do will stop 
  that.
  Willow walks out the back door onto the porch, arms full of weapons. She 
    freezes when she sees Principal Wood.
WILLOW
  Oh, hi. Hey. Well, Buffy, I—I see that our preparation for the school-pep-dance-cheer-drill 
  contest are coming along. (to the potentials) Bring it on!
BUFFY
  It's OK, I filled him in on everything.
WILLOW
  (lets out a sigh of relief) Oh, thank God! If I had to explain all these weapons, 
  I had nothing. (puts down the weapons) 
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Buffy tells me you have been, um—oh, how shall I put it—experimenting. (Willow's 
  eyes grow wide; she casts a "you said what?" glance at Buffy) With 
  the magicks.
WILLOW
  (laughs nervously) Oh! Yeah. Oh, nothing too heavy, though. Just the lighter, 
  safer stuff. Uh, if Kennedy asks, her pointy stuff's right there. See you inside. 
  (to Buffy) So much cooler than Snyder.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  She really almost destroyed the world?
BUFFY
  (nods) Yep.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Remind me not to make her crabby.
BUFFY
  It might be better if you did.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  How's that work?
BUFFY
  Oh, I don't know. It's just—the First is coming, and then look at us: the army. 
  We've got a bunch of fighters with nothing to hit, a Wicca who won't-a, and the 
  brains of our operation wears oven mitts.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Hm. Well, you're redefining the job, Buffy, and that takes guts. This isn't 
  your full arsenal anyway. Show me the vampire.
  Cut to:
  25     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Anya and Spike are talking in the basement.
ANYA
  But you just let him go.
SPIKE
  After saving your life.
ANYA
  For now. That was one of D'Hoffryn's killers, Spike. He won't stop coming 'til 
  he kills me.
SPIKE
  Yet here you are, walking, talking, annoying.
ANYA
  But you fought like such a wimpire, what with the lifting and the running. Why 
  not just kill him?
  Buffy and Principal Wood walk downstairs into the basement while Anya and 
    Spike are talking.
SPIKE
  Anya, think. I fight, demon boy gets lucky, I get knocked out, you get killed. 
  True? (Anya thinks, starts to speak, rolls her eyes) We both know the safest 
  and sanest way of saving your life was to keep you with me, away from danger. 
  (Anya grunts, shakes her head and walks away) No need to thank me. I'm just 
  the one who beat him off. (looks at Buffy) Repelled him would perhaps be the 
  better phrase. (Buffy nods) Demon.
BUFFY
  Figured.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  (from across the room, not facing Spike) I hope we're not intruding.
SPIKE
  Not a bit. And just what brings our good principal to this neck of the gloom?
BUFFY
  I'm showing him our operation. Us.
SPIKE
  Fine by me. (nods) Big fight against evil coming up. The more good guys we've 
  got, the longer we'll all live.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  (still not facing Spike) Is that what you are? A good guy?
SPIKE
  (turns from Buffy toward Wood) I haven't heard any complaints. Well, I have 
  heard a few complaints over the years, but then I just killed whoever spoke 
  up, and that was pretty much that. (Woods turns to face Spike)
BUFFY
  He's joking.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  (glaring at Spike) No, he's not.
SPIKE
  (looking at Wood) No, I'm not. (softly) But...that's the old me I'm talking 
  about.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Why don't you tell me about that?
SPIKE
  Not much to tell. I've changed.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Oh, now that you have a soul. (nods) 
SPIKE
  Yeah. That was a big deal. Very... private. (hurt, to Buffy) What, are you just 
  telling everyone now?
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Oh, come on, Spike. Don't blame Buffy. I asked. (walks toward Spike) 
SPIKE
  (walks toward Wood) Right, the educator. (facing each other now, only a few 
  feet apart) Yeah, I went to great lengths. Lots of trouble, and now I'm unique. 
  Well, more or less. Got myself a soul, whatever that means.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  And how's that working out for you?
SPIKE
  In progress.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Well, you've had some time. You've been in Sunnydale, what...?
SPIKE
  Years.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  How many?
SPIKE
  A few.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Before that?
SPIKE
  Around. (Spike's gritting his teeth, huffing, pursing his lips as Wood needles 
  him) 
BUFFY
  (stepping up, nearly in between them) I think we'd better get back upstairs.
SPIKE
  (staring at Wood, talking cockily in his face) Right. Give him the full tour. 
  You don't want to miss a look at her weapons' chest.
  Buffy walks upstairs; Wood follows.
  Cut to:
  25     INT.     UPSTAIRS 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Buffy's setting up sleeping bags and pillows in Dawn's room while talking 
    to Dawn.
DAWN
  So, I took a look inside that emergency bag of Principal Wood's.
BUFFY
  And?
DAWN
  Smelled weird. Kinda like Grandma's closet, but worse.
BUFFY
  I didn't know what was possible. Anything we could use?
DAWN
  Trinkets, weapons, one very large textbook. (picks up the book, flips through 
  it) Translation's gonna be a bitch, but... Do you know that ancient Sumerians 
  do not speak English?
BUFFY
  (scoffs) They're worse than the French. Anything else?
DAWN
  Uh, yeah. A box. A big, fat, unopenable box. I'm betting whatever the big deal 
  about this emergency bag is, you'll find it in the box. (puts the book down)
BUFFY
  Good. Keep on it. (walks out of the room) Don't you have any real homework?
DAWN
  (following Buffy) Oh, you mean, like, schoolwork? 
BUFFY
  Yes.
DAWN
  Well, I've got a system. It's called flunking out. (giggles) No, just kidding. 
  I'm paying someone to do my work. (squeals) I'm kidding. I love to see your 
  eyeballs change color when you think I'm gonna flunk out of— (gasps)
  Dawn has followed Buffy down the hall into another bedroom where they find 
    Chloe hung from a bed sheet from the ceiling.
  Fade to black.
  ACT II:
  26     INT.     UPSTAIRS 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Resume. Buffy and Dawn are staring, stunned, as Chloe's body hangs from the 
    ceiling by a bed sheet twisted around her neck. Kennedy, Rona, and Amanda 
    come out of the bedroom across the hall and join Buffy and Dawn.
KENNEDY
  What happened? We heard— (gasps and covers her mouth)
BUFFY
  Dawn, get a knife. We're cutting her down.
CHLOE/FIRST
  (from out of nowhere, Chloe/First appears, standing beside Chloe's hanging body) 
  Good thinking. But, on the other hand, why rush? Up or down, I'll still be dead. 

BUFFY
  You're not Chloe.
CHLOE/FIRST
  Yeah, well, neither is she, anymore. Now, she's just Chloe's body.
KENNEDY
  What did you do to her?
CHLOE/FIRST
  Nothing! We just talked all night. Well, I did most of the talking, but Chloe 
  is...I'm sorry, was a good listener. 'Til she hanged herself. (to Kennedy) Like 
  when you called her maggot—she really heard that.
BUFFY
  Don't listen to it, any of you. It's the First.
CHLOE/FIRST
  Oh, let 'em. The only reason why Chloe offed herself is 'cause she knew what 
  you're not getting. I'm coming, you're going. All this—it's almost over.
BUFFY
  We'll be here.
CHLOE/FIRST
  All of you? But wait. I thought— (changing her voice to sound like Buffy) They're 
  not all gonna make it. Some will die, and there's nothing I can do that will 
  stop it. (in Chloe's voice now) Hey, I didn't say it. But I'll be seeing all 
  of you. One by one. TTFN. (disappears in a flash of light)
BUFFY
  What's TTFN?
RONA
  It's "ta ta for now." It's what Tigger says when he leaves. 
AMANDA
  Chloe loved Winnie the Pooh.
BUFFY
  Dawn, where's that knife?
  Cut to:
  27     EXT.     FIELD 
    SOMEWHERE IN SUNNYDALE - NIGHT
    Someone's digging in the earth with a shovel. It's Buffy, digging in an empty 
    field near a tree. She digs, wiping her brow, then continues digging.
  Cut to:
  28     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Everyone in the house is gathered into the living room for a meeting. The 
    mood is somber as everyone sits in silence, except for the soft sobbing sounds 
    as they mourn Chloe's death. There's approximately ten potentials in the room, 
    plus Willow, Dawn, Anya, Xander, and Spike. Buffy comes into the room carrying 
    the shovel.
BUFFY
  Is everyone here?
KENNEDY
  (sighs) All accounted for.
BUFFY
  Anyone want to say a few words about Chloe? (silence) Let me. (paces) Chloe 
  was an idiot. Chloe was stupid. She was weak. And anyone in a rush to be the 
  next dead body I bury, it's easy. Just...think of Chloe, and do what she did. 
  And I'll find room for you next to her and Annabelle. I'm the slayer. The one 
  with the power. And the First has me using that power to dig our graves. (throws 
  down the shovel angrily) I've been carrying you—all of you—too far, too long. 
  Ride's over.
KENNEDY
  (stands) You're out of line!
WILLOW
  No, she's not.
KENNEDY
  (to Willow) You're gonna let her talk to you like that? Willow, she's not even 
  the most powerful one in this room. With you here, she's not close.
BUFFY
  You're new here, and you're wrong. Because I use the power that I have. The 
  rest of you are just waiting for me.
XANDER
  Well, yeah, but only because you kinda told us to. You're our leader, Buffy, 
  as in "follow the."
BUFFY
  Well, from now on, I'm your leader as in "do what I say."
XANDER
  Ja wohl! But let's not try to forget, we're also your friends.
ANYA
  I'm not.
BUFFY
  Then why are you here? Aside from getting rescued, what is it that you do?
ANYA
  I provide much-needed... sarcasm.
XANDER
  (raises hand) Um, that would kinda be my job, actually.
BUFFY
  You're here because you're scared. 
XANDER
  Same goes for everyone in this room.
BUFFY
  Fine. Anya, all of you, be as scared as you'd like, just be useful while you're 
  at it.
WILLOW
  Come on, Buffy. You know everyone here's doing everything they can.
BUFFY
  The First isn't impressed. It already knows us. It knows what we can do, and 
  it's laughing. You want to surprise the enemy? Surprise yourselves. Force yourself 
  to do what can't be done, or else we are not an army—we're just a bunch of 
  girls waiting to be picked off and buried. (Spike stands and walks toward the 
  door) Where are you going?
SPIKE
  Out. Since I'm neither a girl, nor waiting. All this speechifying doesn't really 
  apply to me, does it? (walks away)
BUFFY
  (calls after him) Fine. Take a cell phone. That way, if I need someone to get 
  weepy or whaled on, I can call you.
SPIKE
  (turns to Buffy) If you've got something to say—
BUFFY
  Just said it. You keep holding back, you might as well walk out that door.
SPIKE
  Holding back? You're blind. I've been here, right in it—fighting, scrapping...
BUFFY
  Since you got your soul back?
SPIKE
  Well, as a matter of fact, I haven't quite been relishing the kill the way I 
  used to.
BUFFY
  You were a better fighter then.
SPIKE
  I did this for you. The soul, the changes—it's what you wanted.
BUFFY
  What I want is the Spike that's dangerous. The Spike that tried to kill me when 
  we met.
SPIKE
  (angrily) Oh, you don't know how close you are to bringing him out. 
BUFFY
  I'm nowhere near him. Dawn, get the potentials upstairs, and break out that 
  emergency kit.
DAWN
  What are you gonna do?
BUFFY
  I'm declaring an emergency. (walks out past Spike without acknowledging him) 

  Cut to:
  29     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Principal Wood sets down the slayer's emergency kit next to Buffy.
BUFFY
  We thought you'd want to be here. 
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Yeah, you thought right.
DAWN
  (Kennedy, Willow, Anya, and Xander go through the contents of the bag) That 
  emergency bag's got some neat stuff in it. Weapons, charms, (holds up the book) 
  advanced reading assignments. 
XANDER
  Yeah, cool stuff, but we've seen it all before.
ANYA
  (points to the box) Well, not this, we haven't. What's inside it?
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Mm, I don't know. It hasn't been opened since— (Buffy breaks off the lock with 
  her bare hands) Well, since now.
XANDER
  (pulls out metal figures from the bag) Puppets. That's it! The First hates puppets! 
  Now if we can just airlift Kermit, Fozzie the Bear, and Miss Piggy into town, 
  the First'll be a-running. 
WILLOW
  Those are Muppets.
DAWN
  (takes the figure from Xander) And these things are shadow-casters. You put 
  them in motion, and they tell you a story. (references the book) It says you 
  can't just watch, you have to see.
ANYA
  What the hell does that mean?
XANDER
  It's cryptic. I don't like it. Every time instructions get cryptic, someone 
  gets hurt—usually me.
BUFFY
  You can't just watch, you have to see? (to Principal Wood) See what?
DAWN
  That's where all my fancy translating skills break down, but I think it's an 
  origin myth. The story of the very first slayer.
BUFFY
  I-I saw her. 
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  You saw the First Slayer?
BUFFY
  The other night—in my dream. It's gotta mean something, right?
  Cut to:
  30     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    In the darkened room, Xander strikes a match and lights the wick at the center 
    of a metal mechanical object. The light fills the room, revealing Dawn, who's 
    holding a large book open in her arms.
DAWN
  OK. According to this, I think—you put on those puppet guys one by one. They 
  cast shadows and the shadows tell the story. First, there is the Earth.
  Xander puts the first metal figure on the mechanical object. The light at 
    the center casts a shadow of the figure on the wall. A tribal drumbeat can 
    be heard in the background.
KENNEDY
  What's that sound?
  XANDER
    OK, so far, so creepy.
  
     
      DAWN
        Hmm. OK. 
       
      As Dawn narrates the story, Xander puts the corresponding shadow 
        caster figure on the device:
      As Xander adds the figures to the shadow caster, sounds are also 
        added to the magical soundtrack:
    
     
      Then, there came the demons. 
       
      a representation of a demon
      growling sounds
    
     
      After demons, there came men. 
       
       a representation of men
      chanting sounds
    
     
      Men found a girl.
       
       a representation of a girl
      a girl's scream
    
     
      And the men took the girl to fight the demon—all demons. They—they 
        chained her to the Earth. 
       
      a representation of a chain
      
    
     
      And then—and I—I can't read this. Something about darkness. 
      
       
      
      
    
  
  The shadow casting device starts spinning on its own.
BUFFY
  What about darkness?
  The shadow caster device is spinning, making shadows of the figures on the 
    walls, but the shadows are animated, moving, acting out the story.
DAWN
  It says you cannot be shown. You cannot just watch, but you must see. See for 
  yourself, but only if you're willing to make the exchange.
XANDER
  When did you get so good at Sumerian?
DAWN
  It's not in Sumerian anymore. (the words on the pages of the book are magically 
  changing into English)
  Willow and Kennedy stand, alarmed, as the shadow casters tell a story of 
    a demon attacking the chained girl. The device spins faster and faster as 
    the shadows move up the walls. Suddenly, a bright blue light forms at the 
    center of the device, growing in size until it forms a window of light. Buffy 
    walks closer to investigate it.
XANDER
  But what does it mean?
BUFFY
  It means I have to go in there.
WILLOW
  (panicky) No, it doesn't! Where does it say that? It doesn't say that!
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Buffy, you don't even know what you're exchanging. You don't know if you're 
  ready yet.
BUFFY
  That's the point.
WILLOW
  No. Buffy, we don't know where you're going or how we'll get you back.
XANDER
  Buffy, you can't.
WILLOW
  How will we get you back?
BUFFY
  Find a way. (jumps through the window of light; the portal closes behind her)
WILLOW
  She's gone.
XANDER
  Huh.
ANYA
  What was that about an exchange?
  There's a flash of light, and then a large, growling demon appears.
XANDER
  Ah, this must be the exchange student.
  The demon grabs Xander by the shirt collar and throws him across the room, 
    breaking furniture as he lands.
  Fade to black.
  ACT III:
  31     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Resume. The demon has thrown Xander to the ground. Anya, Kennedy, Willow, 
    Spike, and Principal Wood are standing there in shock as the growling demon 
    now turns its attention to them.
KENNEDY
  Willow! Use your magic. Send him back!
WILLOW
    Um, trying. Redi!  The demon backhands Willow, sending her across the room. Wood pulls out 
    throwing stars and hurls them at the demon. Then he engages the demon in hand-to-hand 
    combat until the demon finally pushes him to the ground.
KENNEDY
  Weapons.
  Dawn hands Kennedy a sword, while also taking one for herself. Kennedy charges 
    at the demon, whaling on it with the sword; Dawn follows suit with her sword. 
    The demon fights the girls, but they are no match for it. It punches Kennedy, 
    sending her across the room. Just then, Spike jumps on the demon's back.
SPIKE
  Get out of here—all of you. Unless you want to end up all dead and useless.
KENNEDY
  (from the couch where she sits, injured) What are you gonna do?
SPIKE
  What I do best.
  Spike slams the demon's head into the wall, but it turns the tables on him, 
    throwing him so hard into the ceiling that he breaks through it and lands 
    on the floor upstairs. The demon breaks through the closed French doors, smashing 
    glass as he leaves the house. Willow sits up where she'd fallen. Xander also 
    tries to stand. Principal Wood helps Anya stand. 
DAWN
  (to Kennedy, who's inspecting her bloody hand) Are you injured?
KENNEDY
  Just hurt. Don't make a case out of it. (to Xander and Willow) How 'bout you?
XANDER
  I think we'll live.
ANYA
  (looks at the ceiling) Except maybe Spike.
KENNEDY
  Is getting thrown through the ceiling what he does best?
DAWN
  (sighs) I'll go check on him.
ANYA
  We've got bigger problems than that. 
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Yeah, demon loose; no slayer.
WILLOW
  We need Buffy.
XANDER
  You gotta get her back. Looks like it's spell'o'clock.
ANYA
  Which spell? I mean, didn't you see that thing? And you expect to reopen the 
  portal without sending Willow off the deep end?
WILLOW
  (frowns, nods) Thanks for your support.
ANYA
  Well, it's true. We're going to have to find another way.
WILLOW
  (shakes her head) There isn't, and Buffy knew it. I've got to get her back.
KENNEDY
  We don't even know where she went.
  Cut to:
  32     EXT.     DESERT 
    - DAY
    Buffy tumbles through the portal and finds herself in the desert. It looks 
    like where she had gone once before with Giles on the spiritual retreat. The 
    lighting is strange, as if brightness and contrast have been turned super-high, 
    giving the scene a supernatural feel.
BUFFY
  Well, guess that worked.
  She hears chanting nearby and goes to investigate.
  Cut to:
  33     INT.     DOWNSTAIRS 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Dawn's holding the book from the slayer's emergency kit. Willow, Kennedy and 
    Xander are gathered around her in the living room.
XANDER
  Dawnie, what's the book say?
DAWN
    Not much. Once Buffy left, it got a little tougher to read. (holds up the 
    book to show the writing has changed)
WILLOW
  Oh. (walks out of the room to the kitchen; the others follow)
KENNEDY
  It's OK. We'll just start with what we know, and take it from there.
XANDER
  Great, so far we know Jack about squat. Let's go from there.
KENNEDY
  You've got the magic, use it.
WILLOW
  I-I-I don't even know what magic to use. 
KENNEDY
  Why not just try all 32 flavors. Worst thing that happens is you go brunette.
WILLOW
  (grabs first-aid kit from kitchen cabinet) That's not the worst thing that can 
  happen. (attends to Kennedy's wounded hand)
ANYA
  She's right. And you know we have a choice. We can risk Willow's life and the 
  rest of our lives to get Buffy back, or we leave her out there. 
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  If we play it safe back here, Buffy could stay lost.
ANYA
  You missed her "everyone sucks but me" speech. If she's so superior, 
  let her find her own way back.
XANDER
  Anya, the First is already up and running. Every second that Buffy's not here, 
  is an opportunity for it to show up and rip us to pieces.
DAWN
  Willow, how would you get Buffy back?
WILLOW
  That's what I'm saying—I don't even know.
DAWN
  OK, but if another witch was to do it, where would she start?
WILLOW
  Uh, physics, principles, basic laws...
DAWN
  Such as?
WILLOW
  Uh, conservation of energies. You can't really create or destroy anything, only 
  transfer.
  Anya scoffs.
DAWN
  I'm sorry, are you helping?
ANYA
  No, but at least I'm not galloping off in the wrong direction.
WILLOW
  Magic works off physics.
ANYA
  Not without a catalyst. If you're talking about transferring energies, you need 
  some kind of conduit.
WILLOW
  Like a-a Kraken's tooth.
ANYA
  Yeah, skin of Draconis, um, ground up Baltic stones, something...
DAWN
  OK. Good.
KENNEDY
  Plus, we need an exchange, like you said. I'm thinking a slayer for a demon.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Right. If we want Buffy back, then we have to find that demon and send it through.
KENNEDY
  It matter if it's dead or alive?
SPIKE
  (standing in the doorway now) I vote dead. The slayer's counting on you, Willow. 
  Get cracking on that portal, and don't be stingy with the mojo. The demon's 
  mine.
KENNEDY
  Hate to say it, (makes quotes with her hands) "Big Bad," but you look 
  like you can barely stand. We're trained. And the only thing we know for sure 
  about this demon is it kicked your ass.
SPIKE
  (smirks) It did, at that. (walks toward the door) 
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Where are you going?
SPIKE
  Something I need. (leaves through the kitchen door)
  Cut to:
  34     EXT.     DESERT 
    - DAY
    Buffy walks up to a group of three men dressed in tribal fashion, each holding 
    a tall staff and wearing different colored head-dresses.
  BUFFY
    Hello? I'm Buffy. I'm the slayer.
  The men are speaking some unrecognizeable language.
RED HAT SHADOW MANSUBTITLE: 
  We know who you are.
BLACK HAT SHADOW MANSUBTITLE: 
  And we know why you're here.
BROWN HAT SHADOW MANSUBTITLE: 
  We've been waiting.
BUFFY
  (nods) Good. That's good then. Um, you know, I know we have bigger issues to 
  deal with, but how'd I understand anything you guys just said? (they look at 
  each other and stand, not answering) Oh, I know, ancient magicks. I just thought 
  it was neat.
RED HAT SHADOW MANSUBTITLE: 
  (the three men start circling Buffy) We have been here since the beginning.
BLACK HAT SHADOW MANSUBTITLE: 
  Now, we are almost at the end.
BUFFY
  The neat of it just left. End of what?
BROWN HAT SHADOW MANSUBTITLE: 
  You are the hellmouth's last guardian.
BUFFY
  Latest. You mean latest guardian. 
RED HAT SHADOW MANSUBTITLE: 
  No.
BUFFY
  OK, um, I have a First to fight, OK. So just tell me what I need to know. I 
  came to learn.
RED HAT SHADOW MANSUBTITLE: 
  We cannot give you knowledge. Only power.
BUFFY
  You know what I think? I'm not really here at all. None of this is actually 
  happening. This is like a play. Like some shadow-play. Some non-reality re-enactment 
  hologramy—
  One of the men hits Buffy, knocking her over—she falls to the ground.
  Cut to:
  35     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Willow's pouring green sand from a bag, creating a circle with the sand. Kennedy, 
    Dawn, Xander and Anya are also in the room.
KENNEDY
  And this is gonna help us how?
DAWN
  The sand forms a circle. The circle acts as a barrier. And the barrier contains 
  the portal.
KENNEDY
  Now what? We hold hands and chant kumbaya or something?
WILLOW
  (hands the bag of sand to Kennedy) Maybe. 'Til we get the magicks up and running, 
  I'm kinda working on my best guess here.
XANDER
  Will, maybe we should wait.
KENNEDY
  For what?
XANDER
  Spike—to see if he can bring back that demon.
WILLOW
  No, I don't think we should wait right now. Opening a portal this size could 
  take days.
KENNEDY
  Better get started.
WILLOW
  (holds her hands in fists and shifts her weight from one foot to another) I 
  think I might pee my pants.
KENNEDY
  You can do it—the magicks, not the pants thing.
WILLOW
    OK. (breathes deeply, then sits down in the middle of the circle) Via temporis, 
    iam clamo ad te, via spatii te jubeo aperire. Aperi! (nothing happens; 
    Willow turns to Dawn) Dawnie, you'd better put on some coffee. This could 
    take awhile—  Willow's interrupted by a flash of light. Energy radiates through the room, 
    knocking everyone down. Willow's eyes turn black, and she screams like a banshee.
  Cut to:
  36     EXT.     CAVE 
    IN DESERT - DAY
    Buffy's groggy and disoriented as she regains consciousness. She's sitting 
    on the ground.
BUFFY
  What is this? 
  Buffy stands only to find she is shackled at the wrists and chained to the 
    ground. She struggles against the chains. The three men are standing in front 
    of her in a circle.
BROWN HAT SHADOW MANSUBTITLE: 
  We are at the beginning. The source of your strength. The well of the slayer's 
  power.
RED HAT SHADOW MANSUBTITLE: 
  This is why we have brought you here.
BUFFY
  I thought I brought me here. Listen, you guys. I'm already the slayer, bursting 
  with power. Really don't need any more.
RED HAT SHADOW MANSUBTITLE: 
  The First Slayer did not talk so much. 
  Buffy pulls on her chains again. The men start tapping their staves against 
    the ground, rhythmically. The man in the red hat fetches a box and brings 
    it to the center of the circle, where he takes off the box top.
RED HAT SHADOW MANSUBTITLE: 
  Herein lies your truest strength. 
BLACK HAT SHADOW MANSUBTITLE: 
  The energy of the demon. Its spirit.
BROWN HAT SHADOW MANSUBTITLE: 
  Its heart.
BUFFY
  This is how you—
RED HAT SHADOW MANSUBTITLE: 
  Created the slayer? (nods) Yes. 
  Black smoke comes out of the box in long tentacles; it seems sentient as 
    it dances around the circle. The men keep tapping their staves rhythmically.
BROWN HAT SHADOW MANSUBTITLE: 
  It must become one with you.
BUFFY
  No! (struggles against her chains) 
RED HAT SHADOW MANSUBTITLE: 
  This will make you ready for the fight.
BUFFY
  By making me less human?
RED HAT SHADOW MANSUBTITLE: 
  This is how it was then. How it must be now.
BLACK HAT SHADOW MANSUBTITLE: 
  This is all there is.
  Buffy struggles against her restraints in vain as the black smoke comes 
    toward her, entering her body through her nose and ears.
  Fade to black.
  ACT IV:
  37     EXT.     CAVE IN 
    DESERT - DAY
    Resume. Buffy's screaming as the black smoke tries to enter her body. The 
    men just stand there, watching. The smoke can't get in through her head while 
    she's screaming, so it rises to the ceiling of the cave and comes back down 
    to her, encircling her hips. Still, she resists. 
BUFFY
  (through gritted teeth) Make this stop!
RED HAT SHADOW MANSUBTITLE: 
  This is what you came for.
BUFFY
  No, this isn't the way.
RED HAT SHADOW MANSUBTITLE: 
  Do not fight this.
  The black smoke heads toward Buffy again.
  Cut to:
  38     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT
    Spike's in the school basement, rifling through boxes until he finally finds 
    what he's looking for—his old leather duster. He holds it up, shakes 
    it out, and puts it on. He walks out with his characteristic swagger from 
    before he got the soul.
  Cut to:
  39     INT.     HALLWAY 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT
    Wearing the duster, Spike walks down the hallway toward the exit. He passes 
    Principal Wood, who's standing in a doorway.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Where you going?
SPIKE
  (without missing a beat) Got a job.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Nice coat. Where'd you get it?
SPIKE
  (walks by Wood without looking at him or stopping) New York.
  Wood watches Spike walk away.
  Cut to:
  40     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Willow's sitting in the circle, black-eyed, and performing magic. The others 
    behind her stand up from where they had fallen earlier.
WILLOW
    Via, concursus, tempus, spatium, audi me ut imperio. Screw it! Mighty 
    forces, I suck at Latin, OK? But that's not the issue. I'm the one in charge, 
    and I'm telling you open up, portal, now!
XANDER
  It's not happening, Will.
KENNEDY
  Give her time. She's getting it. 
XANDER
  Or something's getting her. Will, think you better back up a little. 
WILLOW
  No!
  Willow's arms thrust back behind her, sending magic toward Anya and Kennedy, 
    who immediately freeze. Enveloped in magic, they are lifted from the ground 
    momentarily by Willow, who's pulling power from the two women, through her, 
    to create the portal. The portal opens up in front of her in the shape of 
    a large window of light. Noticing that Willow's hair turned black as she channeled 
    Anya and Kennedy's energy, Xander enters the circle, lifting Willow up by 
    her arms. As he carries her out of the circle, her hair goes back to red. 
    Kennedy seems upset as she realizes what just happened.
  Cut to:
  41     EXT.     ALLEY

    In vamp visage, wearing his leather duster, Spike's fighting the demon from 
    the portal.
SPIKE
  Oh, come on now, Nancy. Call yourself a demon? I thought you were up for a proper 
  fight. (the demon punches Spike, knocking him down) Now we're talking. 
  Spike stands and tackles the demon, head butting it. The demon then punches 
    Spike repeatedly, ultimately pinning him against a wall. Spike then pushes 
    the demon's head away, and kicks it across the alley. 
SPIKE
  (laughing maniacally) Yeah!

    Buffy's still chained to the ground as she stands, addressing the three men 
    who put her there.
BUFFY
  You think I came all this way to get knocked up by some demon dust? I can't 
  fight this. I know that now. But you guys? You're just men. (rips her chains 
  out of the ground) Just the men who did this...to her. Whoever that girl was 
  before she was the First Slayer.
RED HAT SHADOW MANSUBTITLE: 
  You don't understand.
BUFFY
  No, you don't understand! You violated that girl, made her kill for you because 
  you're weak, you're pathetic, and you obviously have nothing to show me.
  Buffy uses the chains that are still shackled to her hands as weapons. She 
    swings the chains, at the legs of one man, and the staff of the other. She 
    knocks them down, but they get up again. A fight ensues.

    IN SUNNYDALE - NIGHT
    Spike and the demon are still fighting. The demon has Spike pinned to a wall 
    again, but this time, Spike grabs the demon's head and twists, snapping it's 
    neck. Spike throws the demon to the ground in front of him. 
SPIKE
  (in vamp visage, Spike takes out a cigarette and puts it in his mouth) I don't 
  know your feelings, big guy, but to me, a tussle like that... (strikes a match 
  on the demon's ear, brings the match up to his cigarette; Spike's now in human 
  face) is good for the soul. (Spike lights his cigarette and takes a puff)

    - DAY
    After defeating two of the men, Buffy walks up to the man in the red hat, 
    holding a staff. She breaks it, and the demon smoke disappears.
BUFFY
  I knew it. It's always the staff.
RED HAT SHADOW MANSUBTITLE: 
  We offered you power.
BUFFY
  (sarcastically) Tell me something I don't know.
RED HAT SHADOW MANSUBTITLE: 
  As you wish. (holds his hand to Buffy's head)

    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Buffy is back in her living room now. An exhausted bunch awaits her—Anya, 
    Dawn, Spike, Kennedy, Xander, Willow. They all stare at each other in silence 
    and in shock for a moment.

    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Kennedy's walking down the hallway, when Willow comes up behind her. 
WILLOW
  Hey. You OK? You've been kinda quiet since...
KENNEDY
  You sucked the life out of me?
WILLOW
  Yeah, since then. Look, it's important that you know what I am, what I'm like 
  when I'm like that.
KENNEDY
  I thought it would be... I don't know—cool somehow. It just hurt.
WILLOW
  I'm really sorry. It's just, you were the most powerful person nearby, and—well, 
  that's—that's how it works. That's how I work.
KENNEDY
  I got that. You told me. I'll see you in the morning. (goes into her room and 
  closes the door)

  51     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Willow opens the door to Buffy's room. Buffy's sitting on her bed, curled 
    up, looking introspective and worried.
WILLOW
  How you doing?
BUFFY
  Thanks for bringing me back. Again.
WILLOW
  (walks to the bed) Well, that's what I do. (sits on the edge of the bed)
BUFFY
  I was hard on you guys today. 
WILLOW
  Aw, it's all right. You needed to be. Although, Twinkies and kisses—also peachy 
  motivational tools. You OK?
BUFFY
  I think I made a mistake.
WILLOW
  What?
BUFFY
  Those men that I met—you know, the shadow men? They offered me more power, 
  but I didn't like the loophole.
WILLOW
  So, you turned it down? It's OK, Buffy. We'll get by. We always do.
BUFFY
  I don't know. They showed me...
WILLOW
  Showed you what?
BUFFY
  That the First Slayer was right—it isn't enough.
WILLOW
  Why, Buffy? What did you see? What did they show you?

    A Turok-Han growls with a battle cry. There's many more behind it, jumping 
    around with weapons. Pan out to show there's thousands upon thousands of Turok-Han 
    forming an army somewhere underground.

  TEASER (RECAP SEGMENT):
  GILES (V.O.)
    Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:
  1     INT.     FOYER 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Buffy and Spike talk near the front door. While Spike talks, show shots of 
    foreign girls being killed.
  SPIKE
    I'm just a guy with his ear to the ground, but even I can feel it. Something's 
    coming. I don't know what exactly, but something's brewing. And it's so big, 
    ugly and damned it makes you and me look like little bitty puzzle pieces. 
  
   
    1a EXT.     CITY STREET IN ISTANBUL, TURKEY 
      - NIGHT
      A dark-haired girl is running through the arched hallway, looking over her 
      shoulder and panting from the exertion of running so fast. She's being chased. 
      Two people in hooded cloaks are chasing her. Two hooded figures hold her 
      down, and a third figure raises an arched, shiny, silver dagger and thrusts 
      down at her.
    1b INT.     PARKING GARAGE IN FRANKFURT, GERMANY 
      - NIGHT
      A girl with hot pink hair with black bangs at her forehead, a nose ring, 
      and a metal collar is trying to escape her pursuers. Finally, she thinks 
      she's safe when she goes through a doorway to the outside near a crowd of 
      club patrons, but she is pushed back inside. Robed men close the door behind 
      them and start to fight with her. She is knocked to the ground, lying on 
      her back. Finally, one of the robed people pulls out a curved silver dagger 
      and stabs her.

  2     INT.     XANDER'S 
    APARTMENT - NIGHT
    Xander's showing his apartment to his new roommate, seeming somewhat peeved.
  XANDER
    You're gonna live in that small room over there. I know it looks like a closet, 
    but it's a room now. (to Buffy) And I hate this plan. I just don't understand 
    when his problems became your problems—more specifically mine. 
  BUFFY
    The school basement is making him crazy. We can't just leave him there. It's 
    just—things are different now—he has a soul.
  Cut to:
  3     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT SUMMERS HOUSE - NIGHT
    Dawn's alone at home. The power's out. She's standing in the middle of the 
    living room, looking around. 
  DAWN
    Mom? 
  A flash, and Joyce is lying on the couch screaming while a dark shadowy 
    figure is choking her as she reaches out toward Dawn.
  DAWN
    Get off her and let her talk to me!
  The noise and wind stop. Blood spatters all the walls, but then fades 
    and disappears altogether. The house is still a complete wreck, but still 
    now. Dawn whimpers and collapses. A golden light fills the room. Dawn looks 
    up and sees a vision of Joyce standing there in front of her, beautiful and 
    glowing, wearing a long white gown. Dawn manages to push herself up on her 
    arms and sit up. 
  JOYCE
    Things are coming, Dawn. When it's bad, Buffy won't choose you.
  The vision of Joyce starts to fade. 
  DAWN
    No! 
  Cut to:
  4     INT.     U.C. 
    SUNNYDALE LIBRARY - NIGHT
    Willow's standing, and Cassie's standing on the other side of the library 
    table. While Cassie talks, show shots of Spike's activities.
  CASSIE
    (serious, leans in) You don't know hurt. This last year's gonna seem like 
    cake after what I put you and your friends through, and I am not a fan of 
    easy death. Fact is, the whole good-versus-evil, balancing the scales thing—I'm 
    over it. But believe me, I'm going for a big finish.
  
    4a INT. BRONZE NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT
      Spike's nursing his whiskey at the bar, when a blonde woman in a faux-fur 
      trimmed jean jacket puts down a pack of cigarettes on the bar in front of 
      him. He raises his eyebrows, turns to look at her and nods to the stool 
      beside him. She sits down next to him. 
    4b EXT. SUNNYDALE NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT
      Spike's walking down a neighborhood street beside the girl he met at the 
      bar. They're smiling and talking and seem to be having fun.
    4c EXT. OUTSIDE AN APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
      Spike's walking the young woman to the apartment building. She starts walking 
      up the staircase and gestures that he follow. Spike stands still, though, 
      keeping his hands in his pockets, rocking on his heels. She comes back down 
      the stairs and stands close to him.
    4d EXT. OUTSIDE AN APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
      Holding the young woman in an embrace, Spike rears back in vampire face 
      and sinks his fangs into her neck. He drinks deeply, but she doesn't struggle 
      much and barely makes a sound.
  
  WILLOW
    From beneath you, it devours.
  Cassie sports a wicked grin, and then her skin rolls back, and her jaws 
    flip back and she's turning inside out until she's a floating ball of flesh, 
    then—poof!—she disappears altogether. Willow's left just standing 
    there in front of the library table. 
  Cut to:
  5     INT.     CRYPT 
    AT SUNNYDALE CEMETERY - NIGHT
    Buffy and Holden are still talking at the crypt. 
  BUFFY
    What do you mean? How do you know Spike?
  HOLDEN
    What do you mean, how? He was the guy that, um—oh, what's the word?
  BUFFY
    Sired. 
  HOLDEN
    Yeah, he was the guy that sired me. 
  Cut to:
  6     INT.     CRYPT 
    AT SUNNYDALE CEMETERY - NIGHT
    Buffy stands with her stake in hand as Holden turns to dust in front of her. 
    She puts down her staking arm with a blank look on her face. 
  Fade to black.
  End Recap.
   
  The Start Of Episode
  Prologue:
  7     INT.     XANDER'S 
    APARTMENT - NIGHT
    There's a knocking at the front door. Xander comes out of his bedroom, groggy 
    and grouchy. The knocking continues.
  XANDER
    (sighs) OK, OK, I'm coming. I'm up. It's 4:30 in the morning. Sweet mamalooshin. 
    (through door) Who is it?
  BUFFY
    It's me. 
  XANDER
    (opens door) Buffy?
  BUFFY
    (walks inside hurriedly) Where's Spike?
  XANDER
    Spike?
  BUFFY
    Spike. Xander, is he here?
  XANDER
    No, he's out. At least he was when I got home.
  BUFFY
    Any idea where he went?
  XANDER
    I don't know, creature of the night, Buff. He's probably out creaturing. (Buffy 
    looks out the window) Why, what happened? Is he in trouble?
  BUFFY
    I hope not.
  Cut to:
  8     INT.     BASEMENT 
    - NIGHT
    Spike's humming a song to himself, digging a hole in the dirt basement floor. 
    He stops, dusts off his hands and looks down. Pan over to show the young woman 
    he killed in the previous episode. He grabs her up by her jacket collar, looks 
    her in the face, and callously throws her into the grave. He buries her in 
    the dirt, still humming.
  Fade to black.
  ACT I:
  9     INT.     FLAT 
    IN ENGLAND - DAY
    A middle-aged man comes into his apartment, reading a book. When he looks 
    up, he notices that the place has been broken into. There's a broken flower 
    vase, plus furniture is disarranged. 
  MAN
    Nora? Nora?
  He walks into the next room and sees a teenage girl lying on the floor, 
    apparently stabbed in the back. She's not moving. The man looks stunned momentarily, 
    then someone cloaked in a full-length hooded black robe tries to stab him 
    with a silver curved dagger. The man's reflexes are quick, though, and he 
    blocks with his briefcase. He runs to grab a sword from his collection, but 
    is attacked from behind by another robed person. He falls to the ground, landing 
    next to the young girl.
  Cut to:
  10     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    HOUSE - NIGHT
    Willow comes home hurriedly through the front door.
  WILLOW
    Buffy? (starts to go upstairs)
  From the living room, Dawn answers. She's sitting on the floor in front 
    of the couch, hugging a pillow, amid the destruction from her earlier encounter.
  DAWN
    She's not here. 
  WILLOW
    Dawn? Oh my God. (goes to her side) What're you— Dawn, what happened 
    here? What— You're cut.
  DAWN
    I'm all right. 
  WILLOW
    Let me see, make sure. (turns her face to inspect it)
  DAWN
    I saw Mom.
  WILLOW
    What?
  DAWN
    She was here, Willow. I saw her. She was here, and she spoke to me.
  WILLOW
    Oh, sweetie.
  DAWN
    No, she was right here, and—and then she wasn't. She—
  WILLOW
    It wasn't her.
  DAWN
    What?
  WILLOW
    At least, I don't think. I-I saw something too, and it looked like... someone 
    else, but it wasn't.
  DAWN
    I don't understand.
  WILLOW
    It's the Big Bad, Dawn. The one we knew was coming.
  DAWN
    But, that's what she said. Mom, she said that things were coming, that things 
    were on their way, and that she loves us. So, it had to be her, right? I mean, 
    her warning was true.
  WILLOW
    (shakes head) I don't know. I just don't think we can trust anything right 
    now.
  DAWN
    So maybe the evil thing messing with you was here too. Only maybe it was the 
    thing trying to keep mom away. 'Cause she was trying to protect me. Maybe.
  Cut to:
  11     INT.     XANDER'S 
    APARTMENT - NIGHT
    Xander's making himself a cup of coffee while chatting with Buffy.
  XANDER
    Why would a vampire lie about who sired him. What's that? Some kind of status 
    symbol for the undead. My sire can beat up your sire. (sits) 
  BUFFY
    I'm not saying I don't believe him.
  XANDER
    You just don't want to. OK, let's look at this objectively. Figure it out 
    in a cold, impersonal, CSI-like manner 'cause we're a couple of carpet fibers 
    away from a case. 
  BUFFY
    Spike can't be the one doing this. He couldn't if he wanted to.
  XANDER
    Why not? 
  BUFFY
    Well, for one thing, pain chip, remember? He can't hurt anyone.
  XANDER
    Didn't stop him from hurting you. (Buffy looks away) Hey, objective here. 
    Maybe the chip's not working anymore.
  BUFFY
    Oh, it's working. I've seen it.
  XANDER
    Is it? Or is that what Spike wants you to think?
  BUFFY
    You think it's an act?
  XANDER
    I don't really know. And neither do you.
  BUFFY
    No, mm-mmm. There's something. I-I can feel it. He's different. He's changed. 
    And, if it is an act, then the Oscar goes to...
  Spike comes in the front door, and Buffy and Xander both stare at him. 
    He stops in his tracks.
  SPIKE
    Well, this can't be good. You here at this hour. There trouble?
  BUFFY
    No, no trouble. I was just— Uh, we were just—
  SPIKE
    (nods) Right. (shuts door) None of my business. No worries. (starts walking 
    to his room)
  BUFFY
    (walks up to him) Spike, I— How was your night?
  SPIKE
    'S all right. And yours? Did you, uh, bag any baddies?
  BUFFY
    One. Vampire. Uh, someone I used to know, actually, a little. Holden. Holden 
    Webster.
  SPIKE
    You knew him, huh? (walks closer to her) That must've been a picnic.
  BUFFY
    Yeah.
  SPIKE
    Well, I'm gonna turn in before I drop. (goes to his room) G'night. (closes 
    door behind him)
  XANDER
    (stands) You see that? You see how he reacted when you mentioned Webs? Cool 
    as Cool Whip. What's up with that?
  BUFFY
    The sun's coming up. I need to get home and check on Dawn. We need to keep 
    an eye on Spike.
  XANDER
    Whoa, whoa, whoa. When you say we you mean me. And me's gotta go to work. 
    I got a big client meeting in a couple of hours. 
  BUFFY
    Xander, this is serious. We cannot let him leave this house until we know 
    if he's killing again. We need to find someone that can watch him.
  Cut to:
  11     INT.     XANDER'S 
    APARTMENT - DAY
    Anya's at Xander's apartment, and she's a little upset with him. Xander's 
    opening all the blinds in the living room area.
  ANYA
    Uh-uh. Forget it, Harris.
  XANDER
    Come on, Anya. You said you'd do it on the phone.
  ANYA
    Yeah, but that— (lowers her voice) That was before you told me Spike's 
    killing again, and now you want me to be alone with him?
  XANDER
    You didn't mind being alone with him before.
  ANYA
    What was that?
  XANDER
    Nothing. Look, we don't actually know that he's killed anyone. You know, lately. 
    Might all just be a mistake.
  ANYA
    Yeah, but you don't think so. OK, have you searched his room for clues? Trophies 
    from victims? Killers like to keep trophies sometimes. Scalps, necklaces made 
    from human teeth.
  XANDER
    You know, it didn't occur to me to look, but thanks for the tip. OK, so you'll 
    be safe in here. Plenty of sunlight for you to hide in. (tries to leave)
  ANYA
    (follows him) What? That's it? You're not at least gonna like leave me a crossbow 
    or a flame thrower? Something to protect myself?
  XANDER
    We don't want him to know we suspect anything. Besides if he tries to leave, 
    I don't want you confronting him. Call Buffy and just let her know that he's 
    on the move. You're gonna be fine. (grabs his hard hat and briefcase) 
  ANYA
    Better be, because if I get vamped, I'm gonna bite your ass.
  XANDER
    (walks out the door) Wouldn't be the first time. (smiles, closes door)
  ANYA
    What was that?
  Cut to:
  12     INT.     UPSTAIRS 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Willow's quietly closing the door to Dawn's room. Buffy runs up the stairs 
    yelling.
  BUFFY
    Dawn? Dawn!
  WILLOW
    (softly) Buffy, it's OK. She's OK. Not hurt. She's just exhausted. Finally 
    fell off to sleep.
  BUFFY
    What the hell happened? Downstairs looks like—
  WILLOW
    Hell happened? Yeah. This big evil that's been promising to devour us—well 
    I think it's started chomping. 
  BUFFY
    Oh, God. And it started with Dawn?
  WILLOW
    Both of us. Buffy, this thing knows us. It made us think that we were talking 
    to people we knew. Mine said it came with a message from Tara. But Dawn actually 
    saw... your Mother. This thing—it had me for a while—I mean, before 
    it started letting loose with the pulse-pounding terror. But before that, 
    the lies were very convincing. It just seems real.
  BUFFY
    Lies. 
  WILLOW
    I mean maybe—maybe to confuse us, to mess us up. Or maybe just to be 
    cool.
  BUFFY
    Vampire I killed last night told me Spike sired him—two nights ago.
  WILLOW
    Well, that's impossible, right? So maybe it was another one. A fake-out. You 
    got one too. It wasn't a real vamp.
  BUFFY
    It dusted real enough.
  WILLOW
    Buffy, do you think Spike is—
  BUFFY
    I can't. (sighs) I hope not. But if I'm wrong and he is, then I have to see 
    it for myself. I have to be there to stop it.
  Fade to black.
  ACT II:
  13     INT.     XANDER'S 
    APARTMENT - DAY
    Anya's at Xander's apartment, and she's sitting on the couch near the windows 
    in the living room area. The sun's not shining as brightly through the windows. 
    Anya's staring at Spike's door. She stands, sighs, and saunters closer to 
    it. 
  Cut to:
  14     INT.     SPIKE'S 
    ROOM AT XANDER'S APARTMENT - DAY
    Anya sneaks into Spike's room quietly, holding a stake in her hand. Spike's 
    sleeping shirtless in the bed. She sneaks over to his dresser and goes through 
    each drawer looking for something. The shot shows that Spike's wearing nothing 
    under the sheets. Anya goes through his pants which are on the bed, then through 
    his shirt which is on the floor. He rolls over, and she continues rifling 
    through his stuff. He wakes and grabs her wrist. She's frozen in panic. 
  SPIKE
    Anya, do be specific and tell a fellow just exactly what you're doing here. 
  
  ANYA
    Well, Spike... I'm here, obviously... for...um...sex. 
  SPIKE
    (sits up, retracts) Uh, beg pardon.
  ANYA
    (kneels beside bed, holding stake) You and me. Here and now. Let's go. Let's... 
    get it on, you big bad boy.
  SPIKE
    Wait, wait, Anya. Just a minute. This is not exactly—is that a stake?
  ANYA
    Yes. Kinky. (puts the stake down)
  SPIKE
    Uh, well, yeah, but what do you—?
  ANYA
    Shh. (presses her finger to his lips) No questions. No talking. I can't help 
    it. I can't stop thinking about you and us and our brief but unforgettable 
    time together. I mean, it's—why else would I be here? I mean, it's not 
    like I'm snooping around looking for proof that you're some sort of wacked 
    out serial killer. (laughs) I don't know why I said that. Forget I said that. 
    It's craziness talking. It's just nerves. Nerves. Nerves and-and horniness. 
    Oh, just shut up, William, and take me. Take me now. (breathes hard)
  Anya has slowly inched closer and closer to him while she talked. She 
    leans over his chest, and kisses his neck. Spike has backed away as far as 
    he can, but there's a wall preventing further retreat, so he just lies there, 
    still and unresponsive. Anya notices the utter lack of reciprocation and sits 
    up.  
  SPIKE
    (sighs) Anya.
  ANYA
    Hmm?
  SPIKE
    It's not that I'm not tempted. Obviously, if things were different, you're 
    a right catch.
  ANYA
    I got it. No problem, I understand. (beat) You think I'm fat. 
  SPIKE
    What?
  ANYA
    Well, it's either that or the haircut.
  SPIKE
    Ridiculous. The do's quite fetching. 
  ANYA
    Oh, right. Now you like the haircut.
  SPIKE
    Love it. 
  ANYA
    Sure, as a friend.
  SPIKE
    Anya.
  ANYA
    You know, you were a lot more fun when you didn't have a soul.
  SPIKE
    Oh, come on. Now, I've just explained to you—
  ANYA
    All I'm saying is soulless Spike would have had me upside down and half way 
    to happy land by now.
  SPIKE
    I need my pants. 
  Anya throws him his pants poutily, but she doesn't move.
  Cut to:
  15     INT.     XANDER'S 
    APARTMENT - DAY
    Still pouting, Anya's sitting in Xander's easy chair, reading a magazine near 
    a floor lamp. Spike comes out of his room, clothed, buttoning his shirt. 
  SPIKE
    Didn't mean to hurt your feelings, luv.
  ANYA
    (pouts, doesn't look at him) Who's hurt. I'm fine.
  SPIKE
    Right. Look, uh, I got things to do.
  ANYA
    Don't stick around on my account.
  Spike walks out of the apartment. Once he's gone, Anya puts down the magazine 
    and picks up the phone. 
  ANYA
    (dials phone) It's me. He's leaving.
  Cut to:
  16     EXT.     SUNNYDALE 
    PROMENADE - NIGHT
    There's lots of people bustling about in the streets. A musician is playing 
    his harmonica on the corner. As Spike passes him, the song changes, and Spike 
    starts humming along. Buffy's only a few paces behind, following Spike. The 
    crowd is dense, and he's difficult for her to follow. She watches him go up 
    to a young woman in line to get into a club. He whispers in her ear, and she 
    walks off with him, hand in hand. Buffy tries to follow, but it's getting 
    more difficult. Spike's got his arm around the young woman now. 
  YOUNG WOMAN
    So, um, what kind of name is Spike? 
  Buffy's lost him in the crowd now, looking around hoping to spot him again. 
     
  Cut to:
  17     EXT.     ALLEY 
    NEAR SUNNYDALE PROMENADE - NIGHT
    Spike's led the young woman into an alley.
  YOUNG WOMAN
    What—are you gonna make me guess? (giggles) All right. (they stop walking 
    and embrace, face to face) I'll guess you're a little bit bad, huh? (she kisses 
    him)
  Buffy's getting worried. She walks faster and faster until she's at a 
    jog. 
  YOUNG WOMAN
    Am I right? Are you a bad boy? 'Cause I don't mind. You know, I was getting 
    pretty bored waiting over there in that line. (nuzzles him) I hate waiting. 
    (kisses his neck, he sighs) Know what I mean?
  As Spike's kissing the young woman's neck where he would bite her, Buffy 
    walks into the alley. Spike's eyes widen, and he looks up at her.
  BUFFY
    You know you want it. You know I want you to.
  YOUNG WOMAN
    (following his glance, but seeing no one there) Um, is everything— (he 
    vamps, she screams, he bites her)
  BUFFY
    (smiles) There's my guy. 
  Fade to black.
  ACT III:
  18     EXT.     ALLEY 
    NEAR SUNNYDALE PROMENADE - NIGHT
    Spike's biting the young woman, while Buffy looks on.
  BUFFY
    Now, doesn't that feel better?
  Spike's face de-vamps, and he looks up at Buffy covered in blood. He drops 
    the young woman, stares at Buffy, shudders, and runs away. Buffy smiles and 
    morphs into Spike. 
  SPIKE-2
    How could you use a poor maiden so?
  Cut to:
  19     INT.     SPIKE'S 
    BEDROOM AT XANDER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
    Buffy storms into Spike's bedroom, and throws him out of bed. He lands on 
    the floor next to the bed.
  BUFFY
    Did you kill her?
  SPIKE
    What?
  BUFFY
    The girl. Last night.
  SPIKE
    What girl? (turns on light) What are you talking about?
  BUFFY
    I caught the first act. I missed the curtain call. Did you kill her? Did you 
    turn her? Is she one of your kind now?
  SPIKE
    Did-did you—are you following me?
  BUFFY
    Answer the question. Where is she?
  SPIKE
    (stands) Who knows? I talked to her is all.
  BUFFY
    Really. (crosses arms) Looked like more than talking to me.
  SPIKE
    Well, I certainly didn't off her. Where are you getting this? (grabs a shirt) 
    You know I can't.
  BUFFY
    Right. The chip.
  SPIKE
    (incensed) No, not the chip! Not the chip, dammit. You honestly think I'd 
    go to the end of the underworld and back to get my soul and then— (sighs, 
    shakes head) Buffy, I can barely live with what I did. It haunts me. All of 
    it. If you think that I would add to the body count now, you are crazy.
  BUFFY
    So, what—you just troll the Promenade looking for drunk co-eds cause 
    you're hungry for conversation?
  SPIKE
    (laughs) Oh, is that what this is? Right.
  BUFFY
    What?
  SPIKE
    You're jealous!
  BUFFY
    Don't play games. Not now.
  SPIKE
    (puts on shirt) Yeah, you saw me chatting up another bird, giving the eye 
    to somebody else. Touched a nerve, didn't it?
  BUFFY
    Don't flatter yourself.
  SPIKE
    It burns, huh? But you can't admit it, so you trump up some charge about me 
    being back on the juice. 
  BUFFY
    This vampire I killed told me—
  SPIKE
    Told you what? That I go out? Yeah, I talk to people. Women. Talk to them 
    'cause I can't talk to you.
  BUFFY
    Oh, Spike, save it.
  SPIKE
    As daft a notion as "Soulful Spike the Killer" is, it is nothing 
    compared to the idea that another girl could mean anything to me. This chip—they 
    did to me. I couldn't help it. But the soul, I got on my own—for you.
  BUFFY
    I know. 
  SPIKE
    So, yeah. I go and pass the time... with someone. But that's all it is is 
    time, 'cause—God, help me, Buffy—it's still all about you.
  BUFFY
    Spike, this vampire told me you sired him.
  SPIKE
    That doesn't mean—
  BUFFY
    He said you killed him. Dumped him in a parking lot somewhere.
  SPIKE
    And you believe him? Vampires aren't—
  BUFFY
    I did follow you last night, and you know what? You didn't look lonely or 
    casual to me. You looked like you were on the prowl.
  SPIKE
    You can't know that.
  BUFFY
    So, then, tell me. Tell me what happened. You talked to her, then what?
  SPIKE
    We talked. That's all I remember.
  BUFFY
    All you remember?
  SPIKE
    I don't know. I go out. I talk to people or I don't. It's boring. It all bleeds 
    together.
  BUFFY
    Well, if you seem to forget that much, then—
  SPIKE
    Not that. The taste of human blood. That, I'd remember.
  BUFFY
    You were camped out on the hell mouth talking to invisible people. Recently. 
    How can you be sure of—
  SPIKE
    No! You are wrong. You've got an accusation from a pile of dust and not a 
    shred of proof.
  BUFFY
    So, I'll get some. (leaves the room)

    HOUSE - DAY
    Willow's on the laptop, and Anya's looking through the bookcase. Buffy and 
    Dawn are standing nearby.
  BUFFY
    OK, guys, find me some evidence that he did this.
  ANYA
    Really? Are you sure that's what you want.
  BUFFY
    Find me the proof that he didn't. (Anya sits at table near Willow)
  DAWN
    You only think Spike is turning people 'cause that vampire told you so, right? 
    But that night we were all told things that weren't true.
  WILLOW
    Maybe.
  DAWN
    What? What maybe.
  WILLOW
    Well, just because those weren't the spirits of, you know, our people—just 
    because it was some evil thing, doesn't mean what they said can't be true.
  ANYA
    I used to tell the truth all the time when I was evil.
  BUFFY
    Look, we can't assume anything. We need hard facts.
  ANYA
    Well, if Spike is biting people again, should there be more dead people with 
    neck trauma? Right? We can find that.
  WILLOW
    No.
  ANYA
    No, we can't find that? But that's easy. That computer's a moron.
  WILLOW
    I mean, no, there's not really an increase in neck injuries, but...
  BUFFY
    But what?
  WILLOW
    Oh. Missing people. Eight, maybe. Oh, ten of them. No bodies, they're just 
    missing. Mostly young. Lots of girls.
  DAWN
    So, it's true? What that vampire told Buffy turned out to be true.
  BUFFY
    Maybe. But it still doesn't prove that it's Spike. Right now, he's the only 
    one who knows for sure.

  21     INT.     SPIKE'S 
    BEDROOM AT XANDER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
    Spike's getting ready to go out, when he puts on his jacket. He feels something 
    in his pocket—it's the pack of cigarettes one of the young women gave 
    him earlier. Holding it, he flashes back to meeting her at the bar and killing 
    her. He stares at the cigarettes, shocked.

    APARTMENT - NIGHT
    Xander's watching television and drinking beer. Spike comes out of his room 
    and heads for the door, but Xander blocks his way. 
  XANDER
    No, no, no. You're not going out.
  SPIKE
    I have to go.
  XANDER
    Buffy was very clear about the not leaving of you.
  SPIKE
    I know what the Slayer told you. It's not true. Now let me go, and I'll find 
    a way to prove it. 
  XANDER
    OK, I'm gonna list the reasons that won't happen. One— (Spike punches 
    hi in the nose, knocking him out)
  SPIKE
    Ow! (Spike leaves the apartment)

    Aimee Mann performs her song "Pavlov's Bells" on stage at The Bronze.
  AIMEE MANN
    (singing) This is how it goes. You'll get angry at yourself. And think you 
    can think of something else, and I'll hear the clanging of the bells, 'cause 
    I can't stop you, baby. 'Cause I don't have a bribery in place, no bright 
    shiny surface to my face, so I won't go near the marketplace with what I'm 
    selling lately 'cause this is how it goes...
  Spike's talking to the bartender.
  SPIKE
    She had blonde hair. A nice looking girl. I was here talking with her.
  Spike's talking to a waitress.
  SPIKE
    The other night. I was looking for someone who might've seen her. 
  WAITRESS
    No, sorry. (Spike sighs)
  AIMEE MANN
    (singing) This is how it goes. It's all about shame and whatever they want, 
    don't tell 'em your name.
  Spike looks around the club, and finally walks upstairs.
  Cut to:
  24     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    HOUSE - NIGHT
    Buffy's talking on the phone with Xander.
  BUFFY
    He hit you?
  XANDER
    (holding an ice pack to his face) Knocked me out. He's been gone at least 
    half an hour.
  BUFFY
    Any idea where he's headed?
  Cut to:
  25     INT.     BRONZE 
    NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT
    Aimee Mann's singing "Pavlov's Bell" in the background. Spike's 
    sitting in a chair on the upstairs catwalk at the Bronze, drinking from a 
    flask. A pretty young woman comes up to him to talk. 
  YOUNG WOMAN
    One of them take your wallet?
  SPIKE
    What's that?
  YOUNG WOMAN
    The way you're scanning that crowd—you look like you're out for blood.
  SPIKE
    I'm just looking for a certain bird I met here the other night.
  YOUNG WOMAN
    Hmm, (touches his shoulders) was it me?
  SPIKE
    Sorry, luv. Don't think so.
  YOUNG WOMAN
    Not even if I ask nice? Or are you the type that has to be convinced. (sits 
    next to him)
  SPIKE
    Friendly warning, pet. I'm the type best left alone.
  YOUNG WOMAN
    Huh. I get it. You'd rather I slip into something more comfortable. (she's 
    vamp visage now) Should we pick off the crowd one-by-one, or block the exits 
    and ravish the place?
  SPIKE
    Get away from me.
  YOUNG WOMAN
    What's with the wallflower act? You didn't seem so shy when you were biting 
    me. I'm not asking if you wanna be soul mates, just figured you'd wanna have 
    some fun. (looks into crowd) I take him, you take her—or the other way 
    around. Whatever. 
  SPIKE
    (grabs her) No, you're lying! (she punches him, he pushes her to the ground)
  YOUNG WOMAN
    Is that all I was to you—a one-bite stand?
  Spike and the vampire fight on the catwalk. She takes a vase and tries 
    to stab him with it, but he wrestles it away from her and stabs her with it 
    instead.  
  AIMEE MANN
    (singing) Because nobody knows that's how I nearly fell trading clothes and 
    ringing Pavolv's bell but rarely shows it well. Well, well, well. Because 
    nobody knows that's how I nearly fell trading clothes and ringing Pavolv's 
    bell—
  The vampire woman falls off of the catwalk, landing in the middle of the 
    crowd before turning to dust right in front of their eyes. The music stops, 
    and everyone stares. Then the music starts up again.

    CLUB - NIGHT
    There's a long line outside of the club, and a bouncer guarding the entrance. 
    Buffy walks up to him.
  BOUNCER
    Hey, sweetheart. If you wanna go in, go ahead. (holds door for her)
  BUFFY
    Oh, uh, actually, I need some help. I'm looking for this guy. Bleach-blonde 
    hair, leather jacket, British accent? Kind of sallow, but in a hot way?
  BOUNCER
    Yeah, yeah, I know the guy. Billy Idol wannabe? 
  BUFFY
    Actually, Billy Idol stole his look from—never mind. Has he been here?
  BOUNCER
    This guy your boyfriend or something?
  BUFFY
    No, I-I just—I need to find him, as soon as possible.
  BOUNCER
    Yeah, he comes in here a lot lately. Every night leaves with a different girl. 
    Chicks like Billy Idol. 
  BUFFY
    (looks upset) How many girls?
  BOUNCER
    Look, this guy—this not your boyfriend guy—if I were you, I'd lose 
    him. He's a real player.

  27     INT.     BRONZE 
    NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT
    Spike's walking to the back of the bar to use the pay phone. Aimee Mann and 
    her band are exiting the stage.
  AIMEE MANN
    (to band member) Man, I hate playing vampire towns.
  Spike dials the phone.
  SPIKE
    (to phone) Hello? It's me. I'm seeing— I think I'm remembering. I think 
    I've done some very bad things.
  BUFFY
    (on cell phone) Where are you?
  SPIKE
    I need—I need to see you. There's a house. 634 Hoffman Terrace.
  BUFFY
    I'll meet you.
  Buffy and Spike hang up their phones. When Spike turns around, there's 
    another Spike standing there, talking to him. 
  SPIKE-2
    You shouldn't have done that. It's not time yet. Not nearly. You're going 
    against the plan, but we can make it work.
  Spike looks scared and confused.
  Fade to black.
  ACT IV:
  28     INT.     BASEMENT 
    OF SPIKE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    This is an enormous brick Tudor style home. Spike's walking into the basement, 
    followed by Buffy.
  SPIKE
    Down here. (Buffy hesitates at the top of the stairs) You won't come down? 
    I understand. It's a risky proposition.
  SPIKE-2
    (blocking Spike's way) There's an order. The slayer's not in order. But it 
    can't hurt to play. Get your claws in the mouse, you know?
  SPIKE
    You are not here.
  BUFFY
    (comes down the stairs) All right. What do you want to show me?
  SPIKE
    I've been remembering. The girl. I walked her home. The one you saw. And the 
    one before that. And I think I killed her. And I think I—I think I killed 
    the lady who lived here. And there might be others.
  BUFFY
    Oh, my God.
  SPIKE
    (walks to center of the room, Buffy follows) Here. I-I think I buried them 
    here.
  BUFFY
    Spike, why?
  SPIKE
    Well, I don't know, do I? I don't even know how. Shouldn't be able—
  Spike-2 seems to be visible only to Spike. He's pacing in the background, 
    and starts to sing the same song Spike was humming at the beginning of the 
    episode and that the harmonica guy played.
  SPIKE-2
    (singing) Early one morning, just as the sun was rising, I heard the fair 
    maid sing in the valley down below. Oh, don't deceive me. Oh never leave me. 
    (sits on stairs) How could you use a poor maid so?
  As Spike-2 sings, Spike is distracted, mesmerized by the song, unable 
    to respond to Buffy, who's trying to get his attention.
  BUFFY
    What? What is it? Spike!
  Spike vamps out and attacks Buffy. She had a stake pointed at him, but 
    he wrenches it out of her hand and throws it away behind him, shattering nearby 
    bottles. Buffy throws him across the room. 
  BUFFY
    What are you doing? 
  He grabs a shard of glass and swings it at her, cutting her shoulder.
  BUFFY
    Oh!
  Buffy fights with him, and pushes him to the ground. 
  BUFFY
    Spike, listen to me, you don't want to do this. (he pushes her away)
  SPIKE-2
    And it's just about to get fun.
  Vampires start rising from the basement floor, coming for Buffy. 
  BUFFY
    Oh, God!
  Buffy fights the vampires, who have taken tools from the basement to fight 
    her with. Spike-2 is talking to Spike.
  SPIKE-2
    You know what I want you to do. 
  Buffy continues to fight the vampires, but they manage to get a hold on 
    her, one on each arm, holding her up for Spike. 
  SPIKE-2
    They're waiting for you. Take her, taste her, make her weak.
  Spike stands, and walks toward Buffy menacingly.
  BUFFY
    Spike, no!
  Spike puts his face near hers, on each side of her neck, but opts to suck 
    from her open shoulder wound he created earlier by cutting her with the glass. 
    As he mouths her, he flashes back to all the things he's done—killing, 
    burying, and all the rest.
  SPIKE
    (in human face) I remember. 
  Spike's horrified. His face is one of complete shock and disbelief that 
    he could have actually done those things. He recoils from Buffy, staggering 
    back to the far end of the room. Buffy fights her way free of the vampires' 
    grip. She uses the wooden handle of a garden tool to stake the vampires. Meanwhile, 
    Spike's hiding in a cubbyhole at the back end of the basement, covering his 
    head with his hands. Spike-2 is crouched near him, talking to him.
  SPIKE-2
    You failed them. Now she's gonna kill you. You lose, mate.
  An elderly vampire is having difficulty rising from the grave, only able 
    to get her hand out of the dirt. Buffy grabs her hand, pulls her up, and stakes 
    her. 
  BUFFY
    Sorry, ma'am, but it's my job.
  Buffy walks over to Spike, still carrying the wooden handle. She stands 
    in front of him. He looks at her, knowing his fate, and scoots out of the 
    cubbyhole he was hiding in. He holds open his shirt. He's crying.
  SPIKE
    Do it fast, OK? He said you'd do it.
  BUFFY
    Who said?
  SPIKE
    Me. It was me. I saw it. I was here the whole time, talking and singing. (sobs) 
    There was a song.
  BUFFY
    What are you talking about?
  SPIKE
    I don't know. Please, I don't remember. Don't make me remember. (to invisible 
    person) Make it so I forget again! I did what you wanted!
  BUFFY
    There's something here. (throws away the wooden tool handle)
  SPIKE
    Oh, God, no, please. I need that. I can't cry the soul out of me. It won't 
    come. I killed, and I can feel 'em. I can feel every one of them.
  BUFFY
    There's something playing with us. All of us. 
  SPIKE
    What is it? Why is it doing this to me?
  BUFFY
    I don't know. 
  SPIKE
    Will you... Help me. Can you help me?
  BUFFY
    I'll help you.
  Spike-2 is still watching from the staircase. He sighs and sneers, seeming 
    disappointed.
  Cut to:
  29     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    HOUSE - NIGHT
    Spike is sitting in a chair, wrapped in a blanket while the others talk in 
    an adjacent room. Buffy, Xander, Anya, Willow and Dawn are all there. Spike's 
    listening to them.
  ANYA
    And you believe him?
  BUFFY
    You didn't see him down there. He really didn't know what he'd done. It wasn't 
    in his control.
  XANDER
    Oh, an out of control serial killer. You're right, that is a great houseguest.
  DAWN
    Wait, is he—is he staying here?
  BUFFY
    I don't know. But I'm not letting him out of my sight, that's for sure.
  WILLOW
    Buffy, he's been feeding... on human blood. That's gotta do stuff.
  BUFFY
    I'm not keeping him around just to help him. I think there was something there, 
    talking to him, making him do things. 
  WILLOW
    Something like what was talking to us?
  BUFFY
    Maybe. But if it was, it's been screwing with Spike big time.
  XANDER
    So, you want him around because...?
  BUFFY
    Look, there's something evil working us, and if we are ever gonna have a chance 
    to fight it, we need to learn everything we can about it. This thing has been 
    closer to Spike than any of us.
  WILLOW
    And if you want to understand it....
  BUFFY
    I'm gonna have to get close to Spike.
  XANDER
    Nah, it's too dangerous.
  BUFFY
    I don't have a choice. Whatever this thing is, from beneath us, it's bad, 
    and it's only getting worse.

    Giles enters the flat, looking around. He sees the young woman lying dead 
    on the floor. 
  GILES
    Oh, dear God! Robson, are you here? Robson!
  Giles gets up and starts looking for Robson, who's found near a chair 
    in the next room. Giles goes to his side.
  GILES
    You too? (takes off his glasses and starts to cry) Dear God, I thought you—
  ROBSON
    (eyes flash open) Gather them. It's started.
  GILES
    It's all right. I understand. I'll take care of it—
  One of the robed men sneaks up behind Giles wielding a battle-axe. He 
    swings it at Giles.

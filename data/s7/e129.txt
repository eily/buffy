  ACT I:
  23     EXT.      
  MEXICAN CAR - NIGHTJonathan's driving with Andrew as passenger. The old El 
  Camino car is heavily adorned in super-stereotypical Mexican style: older 
  model car with fringe around the top of the windshield and lots of 
  decorations.
  ANDREW(sighs) You keep circling around. Justjust drive straight 
  in.
  JONATHANWill you shut up? We gotta keep it low pro.
  ANDREWYou're just scared.
  JONATHANOf course I'm scared. Last time we were here, 33.3bar 
  percent of us were flayed alive. 
  ANDREWCalm down. No one's getting flayed alive. We got a plan. 
  We're gonna fix all that.
  JONATHANWish I'd have stayed in Mexico.
  ANDREWAh, I didn't like it there. Everybody spoke Mexicalan.
  JONATHANYou could've learned it. You learned the entire Klingon 
  dictionary in two and a half weeks.
  ANDREWThat had much clearer transitive and intransitive rules, 
  OK? Besides, I can't keep having those nightmares.
  JONATHANMe neither. Desde abajo te debora.
  ANDREW"It eats you starting with your bottom."
  JONATHANGonna make it right. 
  ANDREW(getting misty-eyed) We're outlaws with hearts of gold.
  They drive past the "Welcome to Sunnydale" street sign.

  24     EXT.      
  SUNNYDALE CEMETERY - NIGHTBuffy's fighting the fledgling vampire who rose 
  earlier. He's rather a strong and capable fighter against her.
  Cut to:
  25     INT.      
  KITCHEN AT THE SUMMERS HOUSE - NIGHTDawn's eating pizza in the 
  kitchen.
  DAWN(singing) Anchovies, anchovies, you're so delicious. I love 
  you more than all the other fishes.
  Cut to:
  26     INT.      
  BUFFY'S ROOM AT THE SUMMERS HOUSE - NIGHTDawn is holding a slice of pizza 
  while going through Buffy's clothes and holding them up to her in front of the 
  mirror. She accidentally brushes the pizza against a white blouse.
  DAWNOh. Ah, she'll think it's blood.
  Cut to:
  27     INT.      
  LIVING ROOM AT THE SUMMERS HOUSE - NIGHTDawn's playing with the Buffy's 
  weapons. First, she's swinging the battle-axe.
  DAWNTaste my blade, spawn of evil!
  She swings the axe, and the blade lands in some furniture. Then she gets 
  out the crossbow and loads it. She's pointing it around like she's one of the 
  Charlie's Angels or something. She accidentally pulls the trigger, causing the 
  arrow to shoot out. It lands in the living room wall. When she tries to pull 
  the arrow out, a large chunk of plaster comes with it. Her eyes widen, and she 
  looks around for some way to cover it up. She moves the nearby tall houseplant 
  in front of the hole.
  Cut to:
  28     INT.      
  KITCHEN AT THE SUMMERS HOUSE - NIGHTDawn's listening to Mexican music and 
  dancing around the kitchen. She gets a jumbo marshmallow out of the cabinet 
  and puts it into the microwave on a little plate. While heating up, the 
  marshmallow starts to swell and expand; Dawn seems impressed. 
  DAWN(laughs) Cool.
  She jumps when she hears a sound from somewhere else in the house. 
  
  Cut to:
  29     INT.      U.C. 
  SUNNYDALE LIBRARY - NIGHTWillow's still studying at the table, leaning her 
  head over, propping it up on one arm, slouching a bit. Then someone starts 
  talking to her through one of the nearby stacks. It's Cassie, from 7x04 
  "Help."
  CASSIESo, (Willow turns to look) this is the UC library, huh? 
  It's so big. Hey.
  WILLOWI know you. I mean, I saw your picture.
  CASSIE(walks out from behind the stacks to Willow's table) Yeah, 
  I know, it's kinda weird 'cause we never really met.
  WILLOWOr kinda weird because your're really dead. 
  CASSIEYeah well... (laughs)
  WILLOWDid I fall asleep?
  CASSIENo, no, I'm here. I mean, not-not here here... it's kinda 
  complicated. Kind of ironic, too, you know. I wrote all that intense poetry about the 
  end, and here I am again. Chatting you up.
  WILLOWYeah, ironic. 
  CASSIEI knew this would completely freak you out. It's just 
  (sits at Willow's table) she asked that I come talk to you. It's 
important.
  WILLOWShe?
  CASSIEDon't worry. I'm not gona hurt you or anything
  WILLOWWho asked you? What are you talking about?
  CASSIEShe says she still sings.
  WILLOWWhat?
  CASSIERemember that time on the bridge when you sang to each 
  other? Well, she says even though you can't hear it, she still sings to 
  you.
  WILLOWTara?
  Cut to:
  30     INT.      
  LIVING ROOM AT SUMMERS HOUSE - NIGHTDawn's talking on the cordless phone, 
  sitting in front of the television, eating gooey marshmallow. An old black and 
  white movie is playing on TV; it looks like it might be a classic horror 
  flick.
  DAWN(to phone) Oh, come on. She is so dead. Well, he's clearly a 
  psychopath. Is so. What? No, that is not Tom Hanks. Well, what channel are you 
  on? (knock) OK, there it is again. I keep hearing this, like, thumping. (mutes 
  television) (knock, knock) No, I-I can't tell if it's
  The front door flies open. Dawn goes to investigate, and a strong wind 
  is blowing into the house. She struggles to shut the door.
  DAWN(to phone) Kit, are you there? Is there a storm?
  Suddenly, the television is unmuted, playing loudly. She tries to mute 
  it again, but the remote control button doesn't have any effect. She tries the 
  power button on the television itself, but it doesn't work either. Finally, 
  she tries to unplug it, but the old movie still plays with the cord out of the 
  wall. Dawn's eyes grow wide with fear. 
  Cut to:
  31     EXT.      
  SUNNYDALE CEMETERY - NIGHTBuffy's still fighting the fledgling vampire. 
  He's dressed in a nice black suit, wearing a light blue shirt and a tie. 
  They're having quite a row, throwing each other against headstones and such. 
  Finally, the vampire pushes Buffy back against a headstone and grabs her 
  throat, going for the kill, when he stops, and speaks to her:
  VAMPIREBuffy? (laughs) Buffy Summers?
  BUFFYHave we
  HOLDEN/VAMPIREOh, uh. Webs? Holden Webster. We went to school 
  together. European History. I let you crib off my Vaclav Havel essay that time. Youyou 
  really don't remember me?
  BUFFYSure! Sure. 
  Cut to:
  32     INT.      
  LIVING ROOM AT SUMMERS HOUSE - NIGHTDawn's scared. Mexican music is 
  playing loudly. The television won't shut off and is playing the old horror 
  movie loudly. Dawn smashes the TV with an axe and breaks it. She smashes the 
  stereo as well. The music is still coming from the kitchen.
  Cut to:
  33     INT.      
  KITCHEN AT SUMMERS HOUSE - NIGHTShe sees the radiothe one she was dancing 
  to earliersitting there on the countertop, playing Mexican music. She walks 
  further into the room, hoisting the battleaxe, when the microwave oven 
  suddenly comes on.
  DAWNOh, God. Oh, God...
  She smashes the microwave, causing a tiny explosion and shattering glass 
  on the floor. She backs away from the explosion, but she's in bare feet and 
  the shattered glass cuts her. The radio on the kitchen counter is 
  still going. Suddenly, tuning sound comes over the radio, causing the music to 
  fade and a voice comes over the radio:
  JOYCE (V.O.)Dawn?
  DAWNMom?
  Fade to black. 
  ACT II:
  34     EXT.      
  SUNNYDALE CEMETERY - NIGHTIn vampire visage, the fledgling vampire is 
  talking casually to Buffy. 
  HOLDENOK, um, junior year, spring production of Pippin, uh, I 
  did the lighting design.
  BUFFYI didn't see it. 
  HOLDENBut you'd helped me move the lighting board, and I dropped 
  it on your foot. 
  BUFFYRight, foot. Yes, of course. History class. It's all coming 
  back. Sorry.
  HOLDENWell, you know, it's not like I was a big part of your 
  life or anything.
  BUFFYNo, I justI didn't recognize you, you know, your face, all 
  demon, and I think you've filled out a lot.
  HOLDENOh, yeah, well I got into to Tae Kwon Do in a big way at 
  Dartmouth, so...
  BUFFYThat's great. 
  HOLDENYeah.
  BUFFYSo what have you been up to?
  HOLDENWell, apparently dying. (they laugh) Uh, no, but other 
  stuff. (they start walking) Uhh, you know, majoring in Psych. Really liking 
  that. Uhh, took a year of to do an internship at the Sunnydale Mental 
  Hospital.
  BUFFYWow. That's gotta be a... popular 
  joint.
  HOLDENII keep telling them we ought to get a velvet rope and a 
  bouncer. (they stop walking) Hey, you remember Jason Wheeler, you know, "Crazy 
  J"? 
  BUFFY(leans on nearby headstone) Oh, yeah.
  HOLDENHe always had that shtick of (waves hands around) "Yeah, 
  I'm crazy, I'm crazy."
  BUFFYHow is he?
  HOLDENCrazy. He's been in the chronic ward since graduation. 
  (laughs, then stops) Not really that funny, I guess.
  BUFFYIronic, sorta.
  HOLDENYeah. (face changes from vampire to normal) Whoa. Did my 
  face just change?
  BUFFYYeah. You look human now. You can do thatgo back and 
  forth.
  HOLDENOh, so I'm a vampire. (laughs) How weird is that?
  BUFFYSorry.
  HOLDENNo, no. Feels great. Strong. Like I'm connected to a 
  powerful all-consuming evil that's gonna suck the world into a firey oblivion. 
  How 'bout you?
  BUFFYNot so much connected. (stands and walks away, he 
  follows)
  HOLDENNo, no. I mean, with the stake and the crossyou do this 
  kind of thing a lot?
  BUFFY(stops walking, turns to face him) I'm the slayer. It's 
  sort of a thing.
  HOLDENSo, whatyou like fight vampires professionally? Or
  BUFFYOh, I don't get paid. It's more like a calling. Sinceeven 
  in school.
  HOLDENI heard a lot of rumors about you back then. You were all 
  mysterious.
  BUFFYI was?
  HOLDENWell, you were never around. A lot of kids thought you 
  were dating some really old guy, or that you were just heavy religious. Scott 
  Hope said you were gay. 
  BUFFYWhat? I dated that ringworm.
  HOLDENHe says that about every girl he breaks up with. And then 
  last year, big surprise, he comes out.
  BUFFY(shakes her head) Men. Do I know how to pick 'em.
  HOLDENSo, all that time, you were a slayer?
  BUFFYThe.
  HOLDEN"The", like as in "the only one"?
  BUFFYPretty much.
  HOLDENOh. So, when you said not connected, that was kind of a 
  telling statement, wasn't it?
  BUFFY(puts hands on hips) Ah, Psych 101 alert. 
  HOLDENWell, I'm just saying.
  BUFFYYeah, what I really need is emotional therapy from the evil 
  dead. 
  HOLDENHey, it was your phrase.
  BUFFYI'm connected. I'm connected to a lot of people, OK.
  HOLDENNo. No, I hear ya. 
  BUFFYI really am. 
  Pan down to show that Buffy's cell phone has fallen on the ground behind 
  a nearby tombstone. It's ringing.

  LIVING ROOM AT SUMMERS HOUSE - NIGHTDawn's on the phone, frantic. She's 
  sitting on the coffee table with her back to the couch, bandaging her feet 
  while she makes the phone call. 
  DAWNBuffy, come on, pick up. I don't know what to do!
  Dawn hangs up the phone and picks up the radio that was in the kitchen 
  before. She shakes the radio. Joyce is lying on the couch behind her in the same position 
  as she was when Buffy found her dead in episode 5x17 "The Body".
  DAWN(crying) Do it again! I heard you.
  Dawn stops and turns slowly to look at the couch behind her, but it's 
  empty. The lights go out for a second. When they come back on, Dawn can see 
  that all the dining room chairs have been placed upside down on the dining 
  room table in the next room. The weapons chest has been turned on end, 
  spilling its contents onto the floor. She looks around, frightened, and sees a 
  message written on the wall in blood: "Mother's Milk is RED Today", and 
  there's a bloody handprint below it. The lights dim again for only a moment, 
  and when they come back on, the message is gone and the weapons chest and the 
  dining room furniture are back in their normal configurations again. Dawn shivers. There's a 
  knocking sound: knock, knock, knock.
  DAWNWhy are you doing this!
  Knock.
  DAWNWhy are you I don't understand. (knocking continues) Stop. 
  Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Aah!
  Knocking stops.
  DAWNHello?
  Knock.
  DAWN(to herself) Once for yes... (out loud) Once for yes, twice 
  for no. Mom? (looks around) 
  Knock.
  DAWNMom, it's you?
  Knock.
  DAWNAre you OK?
  Knock. Knock.
  DAWNYou're not. Mom... mommy... are you alone?
  Knock. Knock.
  The house starts to shake, like an earthquake, but not. A strobe light 
  flashes in Dawn's face. Dawn screams. Home decor is falling to the floor 
  everywhere: lamps, pictures, vases, etc. 
  DAWNWhy are you doing this?!

  36     INT.      
  LIBRARY AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHTJonathan, dressed entirely in black, is 
  descending a rope from the ceiling, landing in the library room used for 
  Cassie's ritual in episode 7x04 "Help." He unhooks himself and looks 
  around.
  ANDREW (O.S.)Aah!
  Andrew, also clad in black, has fallen from the ceiling, not quite so 
  adept with the ropes as Jonathan. He lands flat on his face. 
  JONATHANGet up, you wuss.
  ANDREWI have shin splints. (tries to get up) Ow.
  Cut to:
  37     INT.      
  HALLWAY AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHTNow Jonathan and Andrew are walking down 
  the hallway, carrying large black packs on their backs. Andrew has a map of 
  the school and both have a flashlight. 
  JONATHANMaybe we should turn on a light.
  ANDREWNo, they'll see it from outside.
  JONATHANRight.
  They hear a noise coming from down the hall, like glass breaking. They 
  turn to look. 
  JONATHANMaybe we should go get Buffy.
  ANDREWNo way. 
  JONATHANWe should just tell her what we know about this evil 
  Danthazar. 
  ANDREW(they start walking) Think, McFly. Why would she believe 
  us without any proof? We go to her empty-handed, and we'll be coolin' our 
  heels in the clink in a Bell's microsecond. 
  JONATHANI ain't goin' back to the big house. That place changes 
  a man.
  ANDREWThat's why we need proof. Think of it asas trial by fire. 
  A quest.
  JONATHANUna questa.
  ANDREWWe find it. We alert the slayer. We help her destroy it. 
  We save Sunnydale. (they stop walking) Then we join her gang and possibly hang 
  out at her house.
  JONATHANRight. OK. What do we do?
  ANDREWI think we should find the Principal's office and work our 
  way down from there.
  JONATHANOK, uh, um, uh, you go check down the hallway (points 
  left), and I'll go over there. (points right)
  ANDREWCheck communications?
  Still standing beside each other, they both reach into the pockets of 
  their cargo pants and pull out walkie-talkie radios. The radios beep when 
  turned on.
  JONATHAN(to radio) Check. Check.
  ANDREW(to radio) Check. Check.
  JONATHANCheck. 
  ANDREWCheck. Check.
  JONATHANCheck. Check.
  ANDREWCheck. Check. Check. 
  JONATHANCheck.
  They nod to each other, then walk their separate ways.
  JONATHANEcho 2 to Echo 1.
  ANDREWThis is Echo 1. Go ahead.
  JONATHANDo you think they'll really let us join their gang?
  Andrew shrugs. Jonathan walks away. Down the hall, Warren walks out 
  from behind some lockers and walks up to Andrew...
  WARRENNice job.
  ANDREWThere you are. I'm scared out of my frickin' gourd here. 
  
  WARREN(laughs) Take it easy. Take it easy. 
  ANDREWDo you have any idea how hard it's been to act this 
  cool?
  WARRENCalm down, you're doing great. All specs are within 
  parameters.
  ANDREWYou keep leaving me. I hate it when you leave me. One time 
  you died, and I ended up a Mexican.
  WARRENWe've been over this. Now, that death thing was all part 
  of the master plan. Come on, "If you strike me down..."
  ANDREW(doing an impression) "I shall become more powerful than 
  you could possibly imagine." (laughs) Of course. Do you think, maybe, Willow 
  could kill me, too?
  WARRENHey, don't worry. If short round pulls off his end of the 
  bargain, we'll both become gods.
  ANDREW(turns to look down hall where Jonathan went) (doing an 
  impression) "That boy is our last hope."
  WARREN(walks forward to stand beside Andrew) "No, there is 
  another."
  ANDREW(looks at Warren) Wait, really? Who's our last hope?
  WARRENNo, I was just going with it. It was a thing. He's our 
  last hope.

  WILLOWWhy didn't she? I don't understand... I mean, if you can 
  manifest yourself
  CASSIEShe just can't.
  WILLOWWhy not? I don't understand.
  CASSIEBecause of what you did. 
  WILLOWWhat?

  is. I'm sorry.
  WILLOWButBut she's talking to you? And-and she can hear me?

  Cassie) Can she hear me? What's happening. Did she say anything? What? Did she 
  go away?
  CASSIEShe's crying.
  WILLOWNo. No, don't cry. Don't cry, sweetie. Talk to me.
  CASSIEShe misses you, too. She wishes she could touch you.
  WILLOWMe too. Oh, me, too. Oh, God, Tara, it hurts so much. 
  Everyday, it's like this giant hole, and it's not getting better. 
  CASSIEIt will. It can. 
  WILLOWHow? You're gone.

  remember?

  with the cross pendant on the necklace she's wearing.
  HOLDENSo, you meet someone, you form a bond...
  BUFFYBut it never lasts.
  HOLDENDo you mean in all relationships, or just yours?
  BUFFYMy parents weren't exactly the paragon of 
  stay-togetherey-ness. Maybe that's part of it. I think there're people out 
  there who'd make it. I just... target the impossible ones... with deadly 
  accuracy.
  HOLDENYou think you do that on purpose? Maybe you're trying to 
  protect yourself?
  BUFFYProtecting myself? From heartbreak, misery, sexual 
  violence, and possible death? Not so much.
  HOLDENFrom committing.
  BUFFY(sits up) I commit. I'm committed. I'm a committee.
  HOLDENSo it's them? You're reaching out, they're just not coming 
  through?
  BUFFY(shifts her body) It's different. I think you're confusing 
  me because you're evil.
  HOLDENI just think you're in some pain herewhich I do kind of 
  enjoy 'cause I'm evil nowbut you should just ease up on yourself. It's not 
  exactly like you have the patent on bad relationships.
  BUFFYWouldn't it be cool if I did?
  HOLDENAnd what are yousupposed to be settling down already? At 
  21? You know, my girlfriend at college, she's so sweet. We have this great 
  thing, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna go vampify her just so we can be 
  together forever.
  BUFFYSire.
  HOLDENWhat?
  BUFFYThe wordwhen you turn a human into a vampireit's you 
  "sire" them.
  HOLDENCool.
  BUFFYIt's a noun too.
  HOLDEN(stands, leans on nearby headstone) Oh, I have so much to 
  learn. Come on, isn't this insane? I mean, I was afraid to talk to you in high 
  school, and now we're, like, mortal enemies. Hey, wouldn't it be cool if we 
  became nemeses?
  BUFFYIs that how you say the word?
  HOLDENWe're gonna have to fight to the death, aren't we?
  BUFFYIt's the time-honored custom.
  HOLDENWow, reality just shows up sometimes, doesn't it? But, you 
  know, I've got the bloodlust pumping, and I kinda get it. I'm looking for a 
  fight. And, oh, it's nothing personal.
  BUFFY(stands) Oh, no, I mean, you've been great.
  HOLDENAnd fun catching up. I haven't really kept in contact with 
  many of my friends from high school. Guess I'll be looking them up pretty 
  soon. (laughs)
  BUFFY(looks down) Yeah.
  HOLDENHey, I don't mean to be Count Buttinsky here, but you just 
  don't seem as thrilled. Is it because we're gonna fight?
  BUFFY'S 'cause I'm gonna win.
  HOLDEN(laughs) Hello. Two years of Tae Kwon Do and vampire 
  strength. I think somebody's counting their chickens.
  BUFFYYou're not leaving this graveyard. (shrugs) Can't let 
  ya.
  HOLDENDo the words "superiority complex" mean anything to 
  you?
  BUFFYYou think I'm gonna let you go kill a bunch of people? You 
  know I'm sworn to
  HOLDENNo, no. I get the battle against evil. That's not the 
  issue
  BUFFYThere is no issue. Don't issue me.
  HOLDENJust answer me this: whose fault was your parents 
  divorce?
  BUFFY(rolls eyes) OK, you know, this is beyond evil. This is 
  insane troll logic. What do my parents have to do with?
  HOLDEN(sits on sarcophagus) I'm just curious. Your opinion.
  BUFFY(sighs, sits on sarcophagus next to him) They both have a 
  lot of
  HOLDENOff the top of your head.
  BUFFY(hangs head) My dad. 
  HOLDENUh-huh. 
  BUFFYHe cheated. Um, I think he cheated.
  HOLDENSo, of all of these relationships of yoursthat you knew 
  subconsciously were totally doomedWhose fault is that?
  BUFFYIt's incredibly different.
  HOLDENI was just wondering, (stands) is it possible, even a 
  little bit, that the reason you have trouble connecting to guys is because you 
  think maybe they're not worth it? Maybe you think you're better than them.
  BUFFY(glares) Say, there's that bloodlust I was looking for.
  HOLDENStruck a nerve.
  BUFFYI'm gonna strike a nerve cluster in a minute, you don't get 
  off this. I don't remember you being this annoying.
  HOLDENYou don't remember me at all.
  BUFFYYes, I do.
  HOLDENYeah, like, after 30 minutes of reminding. And I don't 
  take it personally because clearly you were in your own little world in high 
  school. All chosen. All destiny. Who could live with that for seven years and 
  not feel superior?
  BUFFYI'm not. My God, if anything, I (hangs head)
  HOLDENWhat?
  BUFFYI just(sighs) if you knew what I've done, what I've let 
  myself become. My best friends don't evenYou'd laugh, you heard some of the 
  things I've done to them.
  HOLDEN(sits on nearby headstone) Buffy, I'm here to kill you, 
  not to judge you.
  BUFFYThe last guy I was with, it got really I behaved like a 
  monster, treated him like But at the same time, I-I let him completely take 
  me over. Do things to me that (starts to cry, Holden stands) I'm sorry. 
  (wipes eyes) Wow, I didn't mean to get all true-confessions there. I don't 
  know what's wrong with me.
  Holden walks forward to inspect a figurine of Mary that adorns a nearby 
  tombstone. He picks up Mary.
  HOLDENThere's nothing wrong with you. 
  Holden hits Buffy in the head with the Mary statue, sending Buffy across 
  the sarcophagus in a flip. Holden jumps over the tomb and lands in front of 
  Buffy, grabbing her jacket, and talking right in her face in his vampire 
  visage.
  HOLDENEveryone's got issues. (growls and goes to her neck, fangs 
  bared)
  Fade to black.

  SUNNYDALE CEMETERY - NIGHTBuffy pushes Holden off of her, and they begin 
  to fight. 
  BUFFY(pauses) You son of a bitch!
  HOLDEN(stands) What?
  BUFFYI think I'm gonna kill you just a little bit more than 
  usual. (she punches, he blocks then kicks her)
  HOLDENAw, come one. I mean, we had a moment. You opened up. It 
  was really sweet. It make me want to bite you. I'm sorry if I overstepped my 
  bounds. I'm just new to this mortal enemy stuff. (she stands, he kicks her) 
  Pretty fast learner, though, right?
  Buffy kicks him and jumps him, pushing him (and herself) through a 
  stained glass window into a nearby crypt.

  LIVING ROOM AT SUMMERS HOUSE - NIGHTDawn's alone at home. The power's out. 
  She's standing in the middle of the living room, looking around. In the 
  background, there's a sound something like a cross between roaring wind and a 
  growling animal.
  DAWNI hear you. I hear you breathing. Are you hurting my mother? 
  Are you keeping her from coming back to me?
  A strobe-like flash lights the room momentarily. A white-eyed Joyce is 
  lying on the couch one second, and then gone the 
  next.     
  DAWNMom? I see you. I'm coming towards you, OK? 
  Another flash, and Joyce is lying on the couch screaming while a dark 
  shadowy figure is choking her as she reaches out toward Dawn.
  DAWNShe's trying to talk to me. Get off her and let her talk to 
  me! (to herself) The axe! 
  Dawn gets down on the floor, crawling around looking for the battleaxe. 
  Suddenly the shadowy figure has the axe and swings it at Dawn's head. She 
  screams. It just misses her. 
  SHADOWY VOICEGet out!
  Dawn runs toward the front door, which has swung open again. Wind is 
  blowing hard into the house. She almost goes out, but stops in 
  mid-stride.
  DAWNNo! (shuts door) She's my mother. I'm staying.

  JONATHANSeeing the high school again, part of me wishes I could

  ANDREWEverything's shifting around. I feel like we're in 
  Hellraiser. I hate Pinhead.
  JONATHANLet me see that. (takes map) Did we circle all the way 
  around? Maybe we should start over
  Andrew's looking around while Jonathan inspects the map. Andrew sees 
  Warren standing by a door. 
  ANDREW(points to the door) There it is.
  JONATHANAre you sure? (shines flashlight on door. Warren has 
  vanished, and there's no one there)

  Andrew takes a pickaxe and starts digging.

  Holden. Finally he falls to the ground. Buffy straddles his chest, pointing a 
  stake at his heart. 
  BUFFYSee? You're dead. That enough of a moment for ya?
  HOLDEN(changes from vamp visage to human face) OK. But are you 
  killing me 'cause I'm evil or because you opened up?
  BUFFY(sighs, stands) Uhh! (he tries to get up and she kicks him 
  in the face. he laughs) What is wrong with you?
  HOLDEN(stands) Nothing. I got no worries. I'm dead. The biggest 
  thing on my mind is whether or not Tricia Waldman came to my funeral or not. 
  Do you remember her? Ohhbiteable.
  BUFFYSee, this is what I hate about you vampires. Sex and death 
  and love and painit's all the same damn thing to you.
  HOLDEN(walks around) Well, you know it'sit's kind of a guy 
  thing. We talk about nailing a girl, there's all this
  BUFFYNo, it is not the same. With vampires, it is completely 
  Believe me, I know. 
  HOLDEN(stops) Oh, my God! 
  BUFFYOh, your God what?
  HOLDENOh, well, you know, not my God, because I defy him and all 
  of his works, butDoes he exist? Is there word on that, by the way?
  BUFFYNothing solid.
  HOLDENOh. I keep getting off topic because my mind is racing 
  here. (takes off jacket) All right. I'll make a deal with you. We fight. To 
  the death. Great. That last fight was just exhilarating. And I actually had a 
  move coming up to block that stake. (walks toward Buffy) But you have to 
  answer one question, and if I'm right, I get to ask anythingno secrets, no 
  defensiveness, anything I want to know.
  BUFFYWhat's your question?
  HOLDENYour last relationshipwas it with a vampire?

  across from Cassie. 
  WILLOWI don't know where to start. Um, after Warren shot youyou 
  know all about that, what happened? It was horrible. I was horrible. II lost 
  myself, the regular me.
  CASSIEWell, you were grieving.
  WILLOWA lot of people grieve. They don't make with the flaying. 
  I hurt so many people.
  CASSIEIt was the power.
  WILLOWI am the power. It's in me. Did I mention the random 
  destruction of property? The Magic Box is not so much a box now
  CASSIEThe power is bigger than you are.
  WILLOWI know, but
  CASSIEThings are more clear where Tara is, where we are. We can 
  see your path, and you have to stop. You can't use magic again, not ever.
  WILLOWBlack magic, of course. But Giles says it isn't as simple 
  as-as quitting it all cold-turkey
  CASSIEIt's too dangerous. You can't take the chance that you'll 
  lose control.
  WILLOWI-I don't want to. I-I can't. I never want to cause that 
  kind of pain.
  CASSIEOf course you don't.
  WILLOWSo, I won't. I'm gonna be OK.
  CASSIEShe says...
  WILLOWWhat?
  CASSIEYou're not gonna be OK. You're gonna kill everybody.

  BASEMENT AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHTJonathan and Andrew are digging up the 
  dirt in the room. 
  JONATHANWe almost got this thing uncovered. 
  ANDREWYep. 
  JONATHANI hope Buffy'll know how to destroy it. (stops digging) 
  36-19-27! That's it! That was my locker combination. (digs) God, it's been 
  bugging me all night.
  ANDREWDude, we spent the last few years trying to forget about 
  high school. Why are you trying so hard to remember it? 
  JONATHANI don't know. I guess I miss it. Don't you?
  ANDREWYeah, I really miss it. 
  JONATHAN(stops digging) No, I'm serious. I really miss it. Time 
  goes by, and everything drops away. (Andrew stops digging, looks at Jonathan) 
  All the cruelty, all the pain, all that humiliation. It all washes away. 
  Andrew looks over Jonathan's shoulder and sees Warren standing there, 
  staring at him.
  JONATHANI miss my friends. I miss my enemies. I miss the people 
  I talked to every day. I miss the people who never knew I existed. I miss 'em 
  all. I want to talk to them, you know. I want to find out how they're doing. I 
  want to know what's going on in their lives. 
  ANDREWYou know what? They don't wanna talk to youall those 
  people you just mentioned. Not one of them is sitting around going, "I wonder 
  what Jonathan's up to right now." Not one of them cares about you. 
  JONATHANWell, I still care about them. That's why I'm here. 
  Jonathan goes back to digging, and Andrew follows suit. Pan out to show 
  that they are uncovering a 6-foot wide circular object made of metal molded

  of the books open to a specific page. The strange breathing sound is still 
  present.
  DAWNI know you're there. I will cast you out. My mother needs to 
  talk to me. 
  Dawn's holding a bowl and sprinkles dust from the bowl on the ground in 
  front of her. A force pushes her backwards across the room. She stops when her 
  back hits the wall, but she's still got the bowl in her lap.
  DAWNI cast you from this place. (sprinkles dust) It is your 
  poison and your bane. (sprinkles dust)
  Something scratches Dawn's face, leaving a bloody gash, and she screams. 
  
  DAWN(sprinkles dust) It is the skin that is cut from your flesh!

  BUFFYAnd the joke is... he loved me. I mean, in his own sick, 
  soulless way, he really did care for me. But I-I didn't want to be loved.
  HOLDENDidn't you?
  BUFFYI have all this power. I didn't ask for it. I don't deserve 
  it. It's like... I wanted to be punished. I wanted to hurt like I thought I 
  deserved. I sorta thinkyou know, this is, um, complicated. If you'd rather 
  just fight...
  HOLDEN(leans back) Tell me.
  BUFFYI feel like I'm worse than anyone. Honestly, I'm beneath 
  them. My friends, my boyfriends. I feel like I'm not worthy of their love. 
  'Cause even though they love me, it doesn't mean anything 'cause their 
  opinions don't matter. They don't know. They haven't been through what I've 
  been through. They're not the slayer. I am. Sometimes I feel(sighs) this is 
  awfulI feel like I'm better than them. Superior.
  HOLDENUntil you can't win. And I thought I was diabolicalor, at 
  least I plan to be. You do have a superiority complex. And you've got an 
  inferiority complex about it. (laughs) Kudos.
  BUFFYIt doesn't make any sense. 
  HOLDEN(sits forward) Oh, it makes every kind of sense. And it 
  all adds up to you feeling alone. But, Buffy, everybody feels alone. Everybody 
  is, until you die. Speaking of...(stands) you ready for our little death 
  match?
  BUFFYI suppose. (stands) Thanks, for listening.
  HOLDENOh, you know, there's some things you can only tell a

  DAWNI cast you out with every prayer from every god that walked 
  the Earth and crawled beneath. (thrown across the room, landing on her butt, 
  she continues. her mouth is bloody) I cast you out with the strength of those 
  who love me. (stands) I cast your out with the strength I have inside me! I 
  cast you out into the void. (throws bowl forward) That's right! Die, you 
  bastard!
  The noise and wind stop. Blood spatters all the walls, but then fades 
  and disappears altogether. The house is a complete wreck, but still now. 
  Dawn whimpers and collapses. A golden light fills the room. Dawn looks up and 
  sees a vision of Joyce standing there in front of her, beautiful and glowing,

  see?
  CASSIEYou don't want to know what we saw.
  WILLOWOh, God!
  CASSIEBut if you stopcompletely. No more magic.
  WILLOWRight. Right. Stop. W-what about Giles? He made it seem 
  like it was just as dangerous for me to quit completely, like I'll go off the 
  deep end again
  CASSIEYou can't. If you do so much as another spell
  WILLOWI tried to stop. I-I tried. What if I can't do this?
  CASSIEDon't think that way. 
  WILLOWWell, how can I not? You're telling me I'm gonna murder 
  all my friends. I'm not strong. I'm not an Amazon. I'm just me.
  CASSIEWell, there is one thingone thing you could do to stop 
  it.
  WILLOW(eyes wide) What? Anything.
  CASSIEAnd you could see her. You wouldn't have to talk through 
  me. 
  WILLOW(softly) Tara?
  CASSIEThat's what you want, isn't it? 
  WILLOWOf course.
  CASSIESo go. Be with her. Everybody will be safe, and you'll be

  a better place if you took a razorblade to your wrist
  WILLOWStop.
  CASSIEI can see it now. (stands) Candlelight, the Indigo Girls 
  playing, picture of your dead girlfriend on your bloody lap.
  WILLOWStop it!
  CASSIE(mocking) Oh, baby, you left such a big hole. It hurt so 
  bad. (serious, leans in) You don't know hurt. This last year's gonna seem like 
  cake after what I put you and your friends through, and I am not a fan of easy 
  death. Fact is, the whole good-versus-evil, balancing the scales thingI'm 
  over it. I'm done with the mortal coil. But believe me, I'm going for a big 
  finish.
  WILLOWFrom beneath you, it devours.

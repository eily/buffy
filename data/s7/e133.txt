  1     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Spike hands and feet chained to the wall. He lunges at Buffy, who stares him 
    straight in the eyes.
  BUFFY
    (in his face) I believe in you, Spike. 
  Spike looks at her with a face full of hope and amazement. Just then, 
    the lights flicker and go out. Someone bursts into the basement and pushes 
    Buffy away from Spike. She falls to the ground.
  Cut to:
  2     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    HOUSE - NIGHT
    Robed men break into the house from all angles, smashing windows and breaking 
    down doors. Covered head to toe in long, black, hooded robes, these people 
    have batons and no eyes
  Cut to:
  3     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Buffy goes down the stairs to the basement, followed by Xander. She stops 
    dead in her tracks when she sees the empty shackles that Spike was supposed 
    to be in.
  BUFFY
    They were after Spike all along.
  Cut to:
  4     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT
    Spike is tied to the wheel-like construct with all four corners of his body 
    pulled in opposite directions. Spike's body has symbols carved into his chest. 
    Spike/First morphs into Buffy's form. A Harbinger cranks a wheel attached 
    to a mechanism that hoists the wheel Spike's tied to into the air. Spike is 
    now hanging from the wheel about ten feet from the ground, bleeding steadily 
    from his ritualized symbol-shaped cuts.
  BUFFY (V.O.)
    You know what we're up against. The First.
  BUFFY/FIRST
    Now, Spike, wanna see what a real vampire looks like?
  Spike's blood is falling on the Seal of Danthazar that's right below him. 
    It's pooling in the grooves and being absorbed into the seal. The seal starts 
    to glow. One by one, the pointed tips of the pentagram at its center fold 
    up, forming a pyramid. Light comes out from under it. The pyramid sinks into 
    the ground. The remaining pieces of the seal follow suit. A monster climbs 
    out wearing black leather. Pan up to show its horrible disfigured face. It's 
    bald with a distinct vampire forehead and brows and trademark fanged teeth. 
    It looks gaunt, with extremely hollow cheekbones. It raises its hands toward 
    the sky and looks around the room, growling menacingly.
  Cut to:
  5     INT.     DINING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Red light surrounds Willow then enters her body through her nostrils. She 
    throws her head back and a demonic apparition (huge, with two horns on its 
    head and glowy red eyes) escapes her mouth, lunging toward Buffy. The light 
    disappears, and Willow collapses, crying and twitching, while Buffy kneels 
    at her side, holding her head.
  BUFFY
    We won't use magic to fight this thing until we know what we're doing.
  Cut to:
  6     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    HOUSE - DAY
    Buffy opens the front door to leave, but sees Giles standing there on her 
    front porch when she opens it.
  BUFFY
    Giles.
  GILES
    Buffy.
  Buffy goes to hug Giles, but is cut off when three girls she's never met 
    walk right into her house.
  Cut to:
  7     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Dawn's standing in front of the three girls Giles brought with him. The three 
    girls are lined up against the wall, and Dawn's inspecting them, arms crossed 
    in front of her. 
  DAWN
    They're all slayers?
  GILES
    Potential slayers. Waiting for one to be called. There were many more like 
    them all over the world, but, um, now there's just a handful, and they're 
    all on their way to Sunnydale.
  Cut to:
  8     INT.     KITCHEN 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Buffy and Giles are in the kitchen talking to the three slayers in training, 
    who are already up and eating breakfast. 
  GILES
    Uh, what you fought was a vampire, but it was, um, something more than that. 
    It was a Turok-Han—ferociously powerful killing machines, as single-minded 
    as animals. I think the Turok-Han is here as an agent of The First.
  Cut to:
  9     INT.     DINING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Giles is pacing, talking. The slayers in training are sitting around the dining 
    room table, along with Dawn and Anya. Xander and Willow are leaning against 
    the wall. Buffy walks in, badly beaten from her encounter with the Turok-Han, 
    and addresses the room.
  BUFFY
    They want an apocalypse? Oh, we'll give 'em one. 'Cause we just became an 
    army. There is only one thing on this Earth more powerful than evil, and that's 
    us.

    The Start Of Episode
  
  PROLOGUE:
  10     EXT.     SUNNYDALE 
    BUS STATION - NIGHT
    A charter bus opens its doors, and a couple of people walk down the steps 
    to exit the vehicle. 
  BUS DRIVER
    Sunnydale. Watch your step. Next stop...
  The last person to exit is a young African-American girl, wearing denim 
    overalls and carrying a backpack. She looks around and walks forward between 
    parked buses to the bus terminal building. The sign overhead reads "OVERLAND 
    CHARTERS". The girl looks at the building, but the doors are closed and 
    no lights are on. 
  She looks around anxiously, and goes to the nearby pay phone, grabs the 
    phone book, and start flipping through it. The page she's searching reads 
    "SUNNYDALE" along the side, and "S SOTER-SULLIVAN" across 
    the top. The girl runs her finger down through the names, searching, before 
    she realizes that the page she needs has been torn out of the book. When she 
    looks up from the book, she sees a black-robed, hooded, eyeless man approaching 
    her. She drops the phone book and turns to run, but sees two more of these 
    men, the Bringers, coming toward her with knives in their hands. She backs 
    up against the wall, panicked and breathing heavily, and sinks down to the 
    ground. 
  Just then, the pair of Bringers between the buses are lifted off the ground 
    and go flying apart, revealing Buffy, who had thrown them to the ground. The 
    third Bringer runs away while the two Buffy attacked come back for more. One 
    lunges at her with his knife, but Buffy grabs his hand and stabs the other 
    Bringer with the knife he's holding. The stabbed Bringer doubles over in pain, 
    and Buffy kicks him to the ground. Buffy continues to wrestle with the other 
    Bringer, ultimately breaking his neck. Buffy then sees the one who started 
    running away, and calls out to him. 
  BUFFY
    (yells) Hey! (bends to pick up a Bringer's knife at her feet) Try picking 
    on someone my own size. 
  Buffy hurls the knife at the fleeing Bringer, landing it in his back, 
    stabbing him through the heart.
  BRINGER
    Ow! Uh! (falls to the ground) 
  Buffy walks up to Rona, who is still cowering on the ground.
  BUFFY
    Rona, right? (Rona nods) I just got word you were arriving. (offers Rona a 
    hand to help her up)
  RONA
    (takes Buffy's hand, stands) You're her!
  BUFFY
    Her is me.
  RONA
    (still out of breath, looking around the parking lot) You know, I thought, 
    uh—they told me I'd be safe here.
  BUFFY
    Right. Well, you are. I mean, you will be...safer...with me around. 
  RONA
    That's good.
  BUFFY
    (starts to walk away) Next time you're attacked—
  RONA
    (follows Buffy, panicked) Whoa, whoa—next time? You saying I'm gonna 
    get attacked again? 
  BUFFY
    Welcome to the hellmouth.
  Fade to black.

  ACT I:
  11     INT.     WILLOW'S 
    BEDROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAYBREAK
    Pan from window to the bedroom floor, where Willow's tossing and turning in 
    a sleeping bag. 
  KENNEDY (O.S.)
    You don't have to do this. 
  Pan up to show Kennedy is lying on the foot of the bed, with one arm bent 
    at the elbow, propping her head up on her hand, talking to Willow.
  KENNEDY
    Flooring it. In the bag. 'Cause (pats the bed behind her) nice big comfy bed 
    right here. I mean, you ought to know. Your bed.
  WILLOW
    (wide eyed and stiff, lying on her back) Yeah, but no. I'm OK. I just, I like 
    it down here. (pats the sleeping bag) It's firm.
  KENNEDY
    (chuckles) Funny, you look a little uncomfortable. Or... is it just me?
  WILLOW
    No. I'm just, uh, uneasy 'cause Buffy's out.
  KENNEDY
    Right. How many girls arriving this time?
  WILLOW
    Just one. But since Giles has the coven searching for other slayers-in-waiting 
    to send 'em our way, I bet we'll be seeing a lot more soon enough.
  KENNEDY
    (moves the arm that was propping her head, flips her long brown hair, and 
    snuggles her face into her pillow, still looking at Willow) So, you're saying 
    I should enjoy having this bed all to myself as long as I can?
  WILLOW
    It is starting to get crowded around here.
  KENNEDY
    (props her head on her hand again) Totally. And with this many girls, well, 
    I'm just saying if we don't get another bathroom in this house soon, things 
    are gonna get ugly.
  WILLOW
    Sounds like somebody had to share mirror time with a bunch of siblings.
  KENNEDY
    Somebody not me. I only got a half-sister and we didn't have to share. Her 
    bedroom was in another wing of the house.
  WILLOW
    (staring) Wing? Your house had wings?
  KENNEDY
    Yeah. Just a couple. A few. Our summer home in the Hamptons didn't have any 
    at all. Well, one, actually.
  WILLOW
    Huh. Well, that's—that's ... huh.
  KENNEDY
    But never mind my deal. What's your story, Willow, I mean, witchcraft? Wow, 
    that sounds new-agey.
  WILLOW
    No, it's safe to say that what I practice is definitely old-agey.
  KENNEDY
    (nods) So, show me a trick.
  WILLOW
    A trick?
  KENNEDY
    You know, pull a rabbit out of something, or make something float.
  WILLOW
    Uh, yeah, listen, Kennedy, um, it's almost morning. We really need to get 
    some sleep.
  KENNEDY
    Hey, if I wanted to sleep, I'd be downstairs catching Z's with the other girls.
  Cut to:
  12     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Molly's sitting on a chair, talking to three slayers-in-training, who are 
    all lined up on the floor in front of her lying in sleeping bags on their 
    bellies, heads propped up on their elbows, looking intently at her. There's 
    a brunette Hispanic girl, a blonde girl with a southern accent, and a tall, 
    skinny red-head girl.
  MOLLY
    Annabelle was all, "Control your fear, control your fear." Meanwhile, 
    she's the one that goes scampering off, right into that Turok-Han vampire. 
    Poor Annie.
  BLONDE SLAYER-IN-TRAINING
    Great, so the slayer who's supposed to protect us let her get killed?
  MOLLY
    She didn't let her. Annabelle was foolish. Buffy can't be faulted by arriving 
    too late.
  BRUNETTE SLAYER-IN-TRAINING
    (sits up) It's not like she could've stopped it. I mean the super vampire 
    messed her up pretty good.
  RED-HEAD SLAYER-IN-TRAINING
    (sits up) No lie, she still looked like a big bruise when I got here, and 
    that was already like the day after.
  BLONDE SLAYER-IN-TRAINING
    And why isn't she back yet? Buffy. She left to get the new girl over an hour 
    ago. (Molly looks down contemplatively) Mabye she ran into trouble. (the red-head 
    slayer-in-training shrugs) You don't think she was too late again.
  MOLLY
    Maybe—
  XANDER
    (sleeping on a couch in the background) Maybe we can save the maybes for a 
    more dayish part of the day, girls. (turns on lamp) Potential slayers can 
    function without sleep. Me, I'm no good without my usual 90 minutes.
  ANDREW
    (in the next room over, still tied to a chair, facing away from the group) 
    I'm with him. Keep the chatter down! Or, speak up so I can hear you. (to himself) 
    I'm bored. Episode I bored.
  Buffy walks in the front door with Rona.
  BUFFY
    You guys are all still up?
  XANDER
    (sits up, fakes a smile) Ah! Who needs sleep?
  BUFFY
    Everybody, this is Rona. (gestures to Rona)
  EVERYONE
    Hi. Hi, Rona.
  ANDREW
    Hey, Rona.
  XANDER
    (leans forward and smiles) Hey, Rona.
  RONA
    (with her arms crossed, surveys the room, sees Andrew) Um... (to Buffy) why 
    is that guy tied to a chair?
  XANDER
    The question you'll soon be asking is, "Why isn't he gagged?" (smirks) 
  
  Anya enters the room with a rolled up sleeping bag, and Giles follows 
    her in.
  GILES
    Molly, why don't you show our new houseguest where the kitchen is. I'm sure 
    she's hungry after her travels.
  MOLLY
    (holding a bag of potato chips, stands) Fair enough. I'm a bit peckish meself. 
    (exits)
  RONA
    (to Anya) Bit what as well?
  ANYA
    That's English for "hungry." (unrolls the sleeping bag and arranges 
    it on the floor)
  RONA
    (follows Molly, to herself) Oh, here I thought "hungry" was English 
    for "hungry."
  GILES
    (to Buffy) Everything all right?
  BUFFY
    (helping Anya make a bed for Rona) She had a welcoming committee.
  XANDER
    So, The First knows potential slayers are making their way here?
  GILES
    (leans forward on the back of a chair) I must warn the coven to be cautious.
  BUFFY
    The First's always gonna be one step ahead of us, Giles. I need to know how 
    to stop it. No, not stop it, hurt it. I want to hurt it real bad. Tell me 
    how.
  GILES
    I—I don't know, Buffy. (takes off glasses, squats down to be on eye level 
    with everyone in the room) I've exhausted all the sources I have left with 
    little result. The Watcher's records are still really all we have to go on.
  ANYA
    I made the rounds myself. Tried to dig up anything useful from the demon community.
  XANDER
    They're a community now? What's next, the Ladies' Auxiliary?
  ANYA
    The ones that didn't attack me, didn't know anything or didn't talk. Either 
    way, we've got squat.
  BUFFY
    Well, squat's not gonna cut it. What about the Turok-Han?
  XANDER
    The vampire time forgot?
  BUFFY
    Time may have forgotten him, but I sure won't. We know stakes don't kill it, 
    but anything in those ancient books about what does? Sunlight, fire, germs?
  ANDREW
    (from the other room) So, Giles, with that thing guarding the entrance to 
    The First's crib, how will Buffy get to Spike? (Giles's jaw drops, and he 
    seems perplexed)
  BUFFY
    I really hate to admit this, but he's not wrong. There's no way we'll be able 
    to help Spike until that thing is out of the way. 
  BLONDE SLAYER-IN-TRAINING
    Spike? Sorry, I'm confused. He's that vampire who's been killing people, right? 
    He's the one you're worried about helping?
  BUFFY
    (stammering) Well, we need him to—he's the one that's been—it's 
    complicated, Chloe.
  BRUNETTE SLAYER-IN-TRAINING / CHLOE
    I'm Chloe, she's Eve.
  BLONDE SLAYER-IN-TRAINING / EVE
    It's just, well, we've been talking, and do we have some kind of plan? You 
    know, any kind of plan to keep us from dying?
  BUFFY
    (stands, sighs) We're working on it.
  GILES
    (stands, walks to Buffy) There is one avenue that we haven't tried yet—
  ANYA
    (stands) Giles!
  GILES
    Beljoxa's Eye.
  XANDER
    And exactly what part of town is that avenue in?
  ANYA
    (emphatically) I told you no.
  BUFFY
    Wh-what is Botox's eye?
  GILES
    Beljoxa's Eye. It's an oracle type creature that exists in a dark dimension.
  ANYA
    Internal vortex more like.
  BUFFY
    Fun.
  ANYA
    Not really, no.
  GILES
    The point is, only demons can open the gateway to it. 
  ANYA
    (to Giles) Excuse me, ex-demon here.
  GILES
    You're still friends in the fold. Murderous acquaintances, anyway. 
  ANYA
    (to Buffy) Look, there's no reason to think this Beljoxa's Eye will have any 
    of the answers we're looking for.
  BUFFY
    I'll take anything I can get. Anya, please, we're running out of time. Spike's 
    running out of time.
  Cut to:
  13     INT.     UNDERGROUND 
    CAVE - DAY
    Spike, still beaten and scarred from his torture by The First, has his back 
    to the rocky surface of the cave. From the close up shot, it looks as though 
    he's lying on the ground with his hands on either side of his head. Pan out 
    and rotate the angle to show that he is indeed chained upright to the rocky 
    cave wall, his wrists shackled. 
  A Bringer comes toward Spike with a knife in hand. As the Bringer lunges 
    at Spike with the knife, Spike shifts his body weight from his feet to his 
    hands, as he lifts his legs up and uses his feet to break the neck of the 
    Bringer. Spike seems strong and energetic compared to when last he appeared. 
    Another Bringer approaches him, wielding a fiery torch, and Spike rips his 
    hands free of his shackles, ducking the torch as the Bringer swings it at 
    him. Spike kicks the Bringer, knocking him out, then starts to run out of 
    the cave. As he gets halfway through the passageway, he sees someone ahead, 
    walking toward him. He considers going back, but pauses to see who it is. 
    It's Buffy—white-shirted, sweetly smiling Buffy. Spike smiles and leans 
    forward—
  Spike's head falls forward as a black-shirted Buffy addresses him. He's 
    still shackled to the cave wall.
  BUFFY/FIRST
    (pacing in front of him) Dreaming of me again, aren't you? Poor Spike. He 
    still thinks I believe in him. Be realistic. I don't even believe in myself. 
    (stops pacing) At least not enough to risk my skin to save your ass. Not enough 
    to face...(turns to the Turok-Han) that. (turns back to Spike) I'm sorry, 
    Spike. But you need to accept this. You know it never would've worked out. 
    You need to let go so we can both move on. I promise, soon it'll all be— 
  
  Buffy/First notices that Spike's eyes are closed, and he's muttering to 
    himself. She walks up to him, getting right in his face. 
  SPIKE
    She will come for me. She will come for me. She will come for me.
  Buffy/First puts her hand up to Spike's face, and traces it without touching 
    him, smiling sweetly. Then she stops, puts a finger in front of his lips, 
    and stares him in the eye.
  BUFFY
    (matter-of-factly) No, I won't.
  Cut to:
  14     EXT.     ALLEY 
    BEHIND A STRIP MALL - DAY
    Someone's emptying a garbage can into a dumpster. 
  ANYA
    Why not? 
  TORG
    You have the nerve to ask me that?
  ANYA
    Come on, Torg, that was like a lifetime ago.
  Torg puts down the trash can he's holding to reveal his horribly disfigured 
    demon face. He's built like a biker, with a large, muscular body, and long 
    stringy hair. But his hairline is unusual—a long zigzag pattern along 
    the crown of his head. He's also got a barbed wire tattoo over his ear where 
    there's no hair. His eyes are an odd color, and his face is red and creased 
    like he's been scarred from fights, his ears are oversized and pointed. He's 
    pierced everywhere—nose, brow, ears. Plus, he's got a goatee and a few 
    whiskers along his jaw line.
  TORG
    Three, but who's counting. You broke my heart, Anyanka.
  ANYA
    Don't be so dramatic, Torg. You don't even have a heart. (laughs) Six spleens, 
    two stomachs, half a brain maybe, but no heart. 
  TORG
    Don't mock this. The night we spent together was...important to me. 
  ANYA
    It was one date. And it wasn't even a date. (Giles rolls his eyes) We just 
    happened to be invited to the same massacre, and—and you hit on me after 
    I had a few...
  TORG
    I remember, you wore pink.
  ANYA
    Those were entrails.
  GILES
    I'm sorry, perhaps we could skip the nostalgia— (Anya glares at him) 
    Sorry, no, no, carry on.
  ANYA
    OK, Torg, look, you open this tiny little gateway to the Beljoxa's Eye for 
    me, and I'll— You and I will go— (sighs) I'll have sex with you 
    again. 
  TORG
    Ugh, please, you're human. The way you look now, I wouldn't touch you for 
    all the kittens in Korea.
  ANYA
    You're rejecting my offer of sexual bribery? (to Giles) What am I, a leper 
    in this town? I can't even give it away!
  TORG
    (grabs his garbage can and starts walking back inside) Come back when you 
    are a leper.
  GILES
    (steps in front of Torg) Um, perhaps this might change your mind. You help 
    us, and the slayer won't kill your clientele and burn your establishment to 
    the ground.
  Torg glares at Anya, then at Giles. He puts his fist in front of Giles's 
    face, then pulls on a claw sticking out of the back of his hand until it makes 
    a crunching sound. He squeezes his fist, then flings blood from his wounded 
    hand toward the back of the alley. A moment later, a portal appears, glowing 
    white.
  TORG
    (toward the portal) Ek'vola mok't Beljoxa do'kar. (to Anya) There's your stinking 
    gateway, Anyanka. (picks up his garbage can) Don't let it hit you on the way 
    out. (walks back inside)
  ANYA
    (to Giles) It's the hair, right? Not attractive?
  GILES
    (walks toward the portal) Come on. (Anya follows)
  ANYA
    Buckle up.
  Giles and Anya walk through the portal. 
  Cut to:
  15     INT.     BELJOXA'S 
    EYE DIMENSION - DAY
    It's pitch black and windy as Giles and Anya walk through the portal. 
  ANYA
    (looking around) God, I hate this place. 
  GILES
    (looking around) Where's the Beljoxa's Eye?
  BELJOXA'S EYE
    Here.
  Giles and Anya walk toward the deep, echoing voice and discover a creature 
    that's got many eyes covering its surface. It's shaped vaguely like a comet, 
    or maybe a huge eyeball with the nerve endings streaming out behind it. The 
    eyes covering it's pink body are of varied shapes, sizes, and colors. The 
    round part of the creature is in a spherical metal cage suspended from the 
    ceiling in by chains.
  ANYA
    Ah! Oh, (waves) Hi.
  Cut to:
  16     INT.     KITCHEN 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    The telephone rings, and Willow picks up the cordless handset an answers it.
  WILLOW
    Hello? No, Giles isn't here right— Yeah, this is Willow. Althenea, hi! 
    How's the coven? Oh, I miss you guys. Still working out that Pleiadian spirit 
    conjuring? What? Oh, OK, when?

    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Xander is squatting next to Andrew's chair, untying him. 
  ANDREW
    Ow! Watch it! That's my joystick hand.
  XANDER
    (rolls eyes) I'm not gonna touch that one.
  BUFFY
    (standing on the other side of Andrew, with her arms crossed) OK, listen up, 
    Andrew. I don't exactly know what to do with you, except that we don't have 
    time to babysit a hostage.
  XANDER
    Especially a hostage that's gotten more than a little ripe.
  BUFFY
    (makes a face, and steps back a few feet away from Andrew) So, I'm here to 
    tell you, if you try anything, try to run— Did you ever see the movie 
    Misery?
  ANDREW
    Six times. But the book was scarier than the movie 'cause instead of crushing 
    his foot with a sledge hammer, Kathy Bates chops it off with— (stops 
    rambling, sees Buffy glaring at him, and swallows) I'll be good. 
  WILLOW
    (comes in from the kitchen) Buffy—word from the underground. Another 
    potential arrived in town the day before yesterday. She's at the Sun Spot 
    Motel, near the highway. 
  XANDER
    The day before yesterday? Why are we just finding out about it now?
  WILLOW
    Bringers killed her watcher before he could tell anyone he sent her. If it 
    wasn't for a particularly powerful seer in the coven, we wouldn't even know 
    about it now. 
  BUFFY
    OK, I mean, (looks out the window) there's still a couple of hours of daylight 
    left. You guys should be safe here. I'll get her and bring her back. (turns 
    to leave)
  XANDER
    I'll go with you. (follows Buffy)
  ANDREW
    (stands) All right, retrieving a potential. Let's do it! (Buffy and Xander 
    turn to glare at him) Or I could just go wash up. 
  Buffy and Xander leave through the front door. Dawn walks in from the 
    kitchen.
  DAWN
    (to Willow) Where are they going?
  WILLOW
    Bring another newbie in from the cold.
  DAWN
    Another one?
  WILLOW
    Well, the more the better, I figure. We need all the help we can get.
  DAWN
    Help. Sure that's cool, but—
  WILLOW
    What?
  DAWN
    I'm just not sure more scared Slayer wannabes translates as help.

  18     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    The slayers-in-training that are staying at Buffy's house are training in 
    the basement. There's equipment there for them to use, and ample space for 
    working out. The redheaded girl is stretching. Molly is juggling stakes. Kennedy 
    is holding the punching bag for Chloe. Rona and Eve are standing on the sidelines 
    watching them.
  EVE
    (shrugs) What—what are we all doing here?
  KENNEDY
    It's called training. Didn't your watcher ever teach you the word?
  RONA
    I never had a watcher. I only just found out what I was—or what I might 
    be—after those crazy-ass monks came after me.
  EVE
    I meant why are we all bothering? It's not like we can make a difference. 
    (Kennedy rolls her eyes)
  MOLLY
    We've gotta try. (juggling stakes) We gotta keep our reflexes sharp. (drops 
    a stake)
  KENNEDY
    We have to be ready. If something comes down—
  CHLOE
    No, something's already come down.
  EVE
    She's right. And what are we supposed to do about it? I mean, I've never seen 
    a real vampire in my whole life, much less slayed one.
  RED-HEAD SLAYER-IN-TRAINING
    I've seen one. (the girls turn to look at her) Well, my watcher once showed 
    me a photograph of one. (beat) A blurry photograph.
  EVE
    (gestures toward her) That's what I'm saying. Not one of us is remotely prepared 
    to be activated as a new chosen one.
  KENNEDY
    (shrugs, confidently) I feel pretty prepared.
  RONA
    Excuse the newness of me, but, uh, just so I understand, if a slayer dies—
  EVE
    Well, when the slayer dies. I mean, nobody lives forever, right?
  RONA
    Then one of us—
  EVE
    Get's activated. Uh-huh.
  MOLLY
    I prefer "called."
  RED-HEAD SLAYER-IN-TRAINING
    I heard there's more than one.
  KENNEDY
    More than one what?
  RED-HEAD SLAYER-IN-TRAINING
    Slayer. There's another one—somewhere.
  MOLLY
    That doesn't make any sense.
  EVE
    Like any of this does. No matter how many there are, one of us is gonna be 
    the next slayer, with the weight of the world on her shoulders.
  CHLOE
    (shakes her head) It won't be me. I mean, not now. I mean, I'm too young.
  KENNEDY
    Doesn't work that way. In fact, the younger, the better. In fact, I'm starting 
    to think it might be too late for me.
  EVE
    Never too late. It could be anyone. Especially since there's so few of us 
    left. They'll just run through each one of us, one after the other. Kinda 
    creepy, huh? All we do is wait around for each other to die.

    Buffy and Xander walk up to Room 25.
  XANDER
    You sure this is it?
  BUFFY
    The clerk said it's the only check-in they've had in a week. Tourism must 
    be down.
  XANDER
    Right in the middle of apocalypse season.
  BUFFY
    (knocks) Hello. (knocks again) It's OK. We're friendly. And we have eyes.
  XANDER

    Buffy kicks the door in and enters, followed by Xander. She sees a girl lying 
    on the floor, face down in a pool of blood. Buffy kneels to touch her, and 
    looks back up at Xander.
  BUFFY
    She's cold. Been dead for days.
  XANDER
    Poor kid. She made it all the way to Sunnydale just to get herself killed. 
    (Buffy rolls the girl over) If only we—
  BUFFY
    (looks at the girl's face) Eve.
  XANDER
    Eve, who's in our house?
  Buffy and Xander stare at each other, wide-eyed and incredulous.
  Cut to:
  21     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    All the girls are all sitting on the floor in a circle, with despondent looks 
    on their faces.
  EVE
    Just my personal opinion, but I don't think the slayer can protect us from 
    The First.
  Fade to black.
  ACT II:
  22     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Dawn's standing at a desk, looking through notebooks. Andrew is in the same 
    room, standing and talking to her.
  ANDREW
    OK, here's another interesting thing: how come the slayer's always a girl?
  DAWN
    I dunno. 'Cause girls are cooler?
  ANDREW
    I think a guy slayer would be badass. Like—like if there was this ninja, 
    a guy slayer would be like, (holds up his hand in a karate pose and puts on 
    a voice) "you may be silent, but this'll shut you up." (does a karate 
    move) Hiya.
  DAWN
    Buffy could stomp ninja ass. (walks to another desk)
  ANDREW
    The silent warrior? Ha ha—I think not. She can't even slay that special 
    vampire. (Dawn glares, Andrew shrugs) Everyone's saying.
  DAWN
    Well everyone should shut up. And you should stop pretending anybody here 
    is your friend.
  ANDREW
    And also, why's she so about saving Spike? He's a worse killer than me by... 
    a way lot.
  DAWN
    Spike was being controlled by The First. And he has a soul now. Besides, we 
    need his help.
  ANDREW
    What about me? Did it ever occur to anyone that I could be a lot more useful 
    around here? I used to be an evil genius. Hello?
  DAWN
    (walks up to him) And what was your genius thing?
  ANDREW
    Well, um, raising demons mostly. (Dawn cocks her head and smirks) OK, so, 
    not for now, but also there was planning. There were, um, blueprints. (Dawn 
    glares) I can be in this, kicking it righteous. Yeah. Oh, oh, yeah.
  DAWN
    (glaring emotionless) Buffy said if you talked enough, I'm allowed to kill 
    you.
  ANDREW
    (timidly) Not even.
  DAWN
    (cocks her head to the side) Even.
  ANDREW
    License to kill, huh? (nods) Pretty cool. You know, Timothy Dalton never got 
    his props 'cause he came in at the end of an old regime, but he had it goin' 
    on. He went rogue with the Broccolis. They were just treading water, stylistically.
  DAWN
    (shakes head) Is there a language that you're speaking?
  ANDREW
    (pouts and sits on the couch) I'm so alone.
  DAWN
    Then maybe you shouldn't've killed your only friend. (walks off)
  ANDREW
    I hate that. You don't even know. 
  DAWN
    I don't plan to.
  ANDREW
    The slayer's not getting it done. (points to the ground) I have got my ear 
    to the ground, and that's the word. (Dawn walks off, he calls after her) Do 
    you wanna play "Kevin Bacon"? (pouts and leans back on the couch, 
    propping his feet up on it)
  Buffy walks in the front door in a huff and looks around. Willow and Dawn 
    are at the dining room table. 
  WILLOW
    Buffy.
  DAWN
    What is it?
  Buffy looks at Andrew, who's on her couch. She glares at him, and he sits 
    up and wipes off the part of the couch his feet were on. Buffy just rolls 
    her eyes and goes into the next room. Xander, Willow, Dawn, and Andrew follow.

  EVE
    (turns to look at Buffy) What's the problem, officer?
  BUFFY
    (firmly, through gritted teeth) I said get away from them now.
  DAWN
    Buffy, what did Eve do?
  XANDER
    That's not Eve.
  BUFFY
    Eve's dead.
  RONA
    (holds up her hands in confusion) I don't—I don't understand.
  All the girls stand and back away from Eve. Eve stands and faces Buffy.
  EVE
    Oops! One more down. Oh, well, can't save 'em all, can ya, Buffy? (turns to 
    face the slayers-in-training) Thanks for the slumber party, girls. It's been 
    real fun the last couple of nights. I learned a whole lot—
  BUFFY
    Shut up, and get out!
  EVE
    (turns to face Buffy) Or you'll do what? I'll be sending a guest over to visit 
    y'all later on tonight, after the sun goes down of course. Try and make him 
    feel welcome before he rips y'all to pieces. Bye.
  Eve disappears in a flash of light (like a television being turned off).

    EYE DIMENSION - DAY
    Beljoxa's Eye is addressing Giles and Anya.
  BELJOXA'S EYE
    It cannot be fought, it cannot be killed. The First Evil has been and always 
    will be. Since before the universe was born, long after there is nothing else, 
    it will go on.
  GILES
    I refuse to believe that. There must be some way to destroy it.
  BELJOXA'S EYE
    What, am I talking to myself here? There's no way.
  ANYA
    OK, we tried. Let's go, Giles. (starts to walk away) 
  GILES
    Are you saying that The First will succeed in—in wiping out the line 
    of slayers?
  BELJOXA'S EYE
    The eye sees not the future, only the truth of the now and before.
  ANYA
    Yes, we've all got that—it's called memory. Can you help us out with 
    something a little bit more demony?
  GILES
    If The First has been around for all time, then why hasn't it attempted something 
    like this before? Why now?
  BELJOXA'S EYE
    The opportunity has only recently presented itself.
  GILES
    Opportunity?
  BELJOXA'S EYE
    The mystical forces surrounding the chosen line have become irrevocably altered, 
    become unstable, vulnerable.
  ANYA
    Something The First did?
  BELJOXA'S EYE
    The First Evil did not cause the disruption, only seized upon it to extinguish 
    the lives of the chosen forever.
  GILES
    Then what has caused the disruption? What—what is responsible for letting 
    this happen?
  BELJOXA'S EYE
    The slayer.

    her.
  RED-HEAD SLAYER IN TRAINING
    We should run.
  KENNEDY
    And go where, Vi?
  DAWN
    Annabelle ran. Look where it got her.
  BUFFY
    Safer in than out.
  MOLLY
    How can you say that? It was here, Buffy, in the house, living with us for 
    days.
  CHLOE
    And you didn't even know it.
  XANDER
    Well, none of us knew it.
  RED-HEAD SLAYER IN TRAINING / VI
    It could still be here. It could be any one of us.
  WILLOW
    No, The First can only take the form of dead people.
  RONA
    Yeah, well there'll be plenty more of those soon enough. We're dropping like 
    flies here.
  All the girls start talking over one another. 
  BUFFY
    Hey! (the girls stop talking) Look, I know you're all scared. You know what? 
    I am too, but Giles and Anya will be back soon, and hopefully they will have 
    the information that we need to stop The First. In the mean time, we need 
    to stick together. OK, we're stronger that way. We cannot afford to fall apart 
    now.
  ANDREW
    (steps up to the table) She's right. Where would the Justice League have been 
    if they hadn't put their differences aside to stop the Imperium and his shape-shifting 
    alien horde? (crosses his arms)
  BUFFY
    (sneers to Andrew) Don't help me.
  XANDER
    Buff, the sun goes down, and UberVamp's on its way. So a plan'd be good right 
    about now.
  BUFFY
    Will, I'm sorry to ask, but—
  WILLOW
    I know, we need a barrier.
  BUFFY
    A major one. Something tells me this vampire doesn't need an invite to get 
    into the house. Can you do it?
  WILLOW
    I'll try.
  RONA
    Try?
  KENNEDY
    You heard her.
  XANDER
    Buff, are you sure about Willow doing the hocus pocus again? I—I mean, 
    last time she—
  BUFFY
    Xander, we don't have a lot of choices.
  CHLOE
    And what if that doesn't work? What if that monster gets through?
  BUFFY
    Then we'll deal.
  RONA
    Deal? Fight, you mean. How are we supposed to do that?
  VI
    And with what?
  KENNEDY
    (to the slayers-in-trianing) With whatever it takes! (looks at Buffy) Right?
  MOLLY
    Buffy, you fought the Turok-Han, and it almost killed you.
  CHLOE
    And you're the real slayer. 
  RONA
    Wh-what chance do we have?
  MOLLY
    Honestly, you staked that thing, and it didn't die.
  DAWN
    No, but that doesn't—
  VI
    Maybe it can't be killed.
  While the girls go on about this, Buffy's just staring straight ahead 
    with her arms crossed. Willow's staring off into the distance, then looks 
    at Buffy.
  DAWN
    That mean we shouldn't try?
  RONA
    There's that word again.
  KENNEDY
    Hey, it's a good word.
  CHLOE
    Give up. Can we do that? Surrender, I mean, so it won't kill us.
  Buffy walks into the kitchen. Willow stands up to follow her, and walks 
    past Xander.
  XANDER
    (jumps, stares at Willow) What?
  KENNEDY

  DAWN (O.S.)
    Um, and exactly how many UberVamps were at the Geneva Convention?
  KENNEDY (O.S.)
    Come on, we're all potential slayers. You know how to fight even if you don't

  XANDER
    (walking into the room) And two more out back.
  MOLLY
    Why aren't they doing anything, attacking?
  BUFFY
    They don't want in. They're here to make sure we don't get out. (turns to 
    the other window, where Rona, Vi, and Kennedy are looking outside) Rona. (holds 
    up a sword)
  RONA
    (comes to Buffy, takes the sword) Like this'll do any good. I mean, what's 
    the point?
  KENNEDY
    (points to the tip of Rona's sword) It's this end right here. Just stick that 
    in the bad guys. Any more questions? (goes to the weapons chest and takes 
    out a crossbow) This'll do me.
  BUFFY
    Are you sure you know how to use it?
  KENNEDY
    (practices loading and shooting the unloaded weapon) Since I was eight. (Buffy 
    hands her a quiver of arrows)
  ANDREW

  KENNEDY

    causing the candle to drop into her hand) You really can float stuff.
  WILLOW
    Just testing.
  KENNEDY
    Oh, right. Heard this voodoo once turned you into the big scary. (Willow blows 
    out the candle) Big, scary Willow—that's something I'd almost like to 
    see—
  WILLOW
    No, you wouldn't.
  KENNEDY
    I said "almost."
  WILLOW
    I needed to make sure. Last time I tried using magic, The First—it turned 
    it around on me. Got inside. I felt it just surging through me, every fiber 
    of my being. Pure, undiluted evil. I could taste it.
  KENNEDY

    (limping) Yeah, I just—I don't understand how Buffy's death mucked up 
    the whole slayer mojo. You know, it's not like she hasn't died before.
  GILES
    It's not because she died. The Beljoxa's Eye was quite clear about that in 
    its enigmatic way. It's because she lives. Again. Buffy's not responsible 
    for that.
  ANYA
    Oh. Oh. Willow and me and Xander and Tara. We're the ones who brought Buffy 
    back. We're—we're the reason The First is here, the reason those girls

    Buffy, you can't take that thing on yourself.
  KENNEDY
    I'll stay.
  BUFFY
    No! (takes the bottle of holy water from Andrew)
  ANDREW
    H-hey, I need that!
  BUFFY
    Willow, Xander, take everyone to a safe location. Get 'em out of here. Now!
  Everyone but Buffy and Dawn follows Willow. 
  XANDER
    (touches Dawn's arm) Have to go, Dawnie.
  Dawn grudgingly goes with Xander. Buffy faces the Turok-Han, who is now 
    on the street facing her as in a standoff. Buffy takes a running leap towards 
    it, kicking it in the chest. It doesn't even move, but Buffy falls to the 
    ground. As the Turok-Han comes closer to her, Buffy takes the bottle of holy 
    water out of her pocket. When the Turok-Han is within arms reach, Buffy smashes 
    the bottle in its face, causing it to roar and retreat. Buffy stands, but 
    it grabs her by the throat and shoves her into a car window, shattering it. 
    The holy water burned the Turok-Han's face, but doesn't appear to have slowed 
    it down any. Buffy runs away, expecting the Turok-Han to give chase, which 
    it does for a moment before stopping. Buffy turns around to see if it's still 
    behind her, but it's gone.

    SITE - NIGHT
    Xander is climbing down scaffolding, still carrying his battle-axe.
  XANDER
    Come on, people, we gotta move.
  ANDREW
    (also climbing down the scaffolding) I'm moving. Climbing's not my thing. 
    I got a inner ear condition.
  XANDER
    Is falling your thing? 'Cause if you don't pick up the pace, I'm gonna come 
    up there and drop your ass.
  ANDREW
    Way to keep up morale in a crisis. (jumps to the ground) No wonder Buffy's 
    the leader.
  Everyone else is climbing down the scaffolding too.
  RONA
    (under her breath) Some leader.
  CHLOE
    This is crazy.
  RONA
    You got that right. (to Xander) What are we doing down here?
  XANDER
    Quieter. Faster.
  Cut to:
  36     EXT.     CONSTRUCTION 
    SITE - NIGHT
    The crew is following Xander around the site to a big open area.
  MOLLY
    Where are we?
  XANDER
    Future site of the new public library, opening up May 2003. If I ever get 
    back to work, that is.
  RONA
    You call this a safe location?
  VI
    It's the middle of nothing.
  WILLOW
    This'll do. OK everyone. Spread out, take positions. (everyone spreads out, 
    except Andrew)
  ANDREW
    (standing alone in the middle of the open area) Um, what's my position?
  WILLOW
    And don't make a sound.
  RONA
    That's the plan? Spread out? That thing is gonna kill Buffy, and then it's 
    gonna come after us. For all we know, it's killing her right now.
  KENNEDY
    (staring at something) Or, it could just skip that part and come straight 
    here.
  Everyone turns to follow her gaze and sees the Turok-Han has found them, 
    and he's growling.
  Fade to black.
  ACT IV:
  37     EXT.     CONSTRUCTION 
    SITE - NIGHT
    Resume. The Turok-Han walks menacingly toward them. Kennedy loads her crossbow 
    and prepares to fight. The others walk up behind her.
  CHLOE
    (staring at the Turok-Han) Oh no no no no...
  Suddenly, the flood lights come on, and everyone turns to look. Buffy's 
    standing there, arms crossed, on a ledge overlooking the open area.
  DAWN
    Buffy?
  MOLLY
    What's she doing?
  Kennedy aims her crossbow at the Turok-Han, but Willow waves her off. 
    
  WILLOW
    Just watch. It's show time.
  Willow leads the group away from the open area. They climb the scaffolding 
    and watch. Andrew looks on eagerly, hanging on the outside of the bars. 
  BUFFY
    (to the Turok-Han) Looks good, doesn't it? They're trapped in here. Terrified. 
    Meat for the beast, and there's nothing they can do but wait. (forward somersaults 
    down into the open area) That's all they've been doing for days. (walks toward 
    the Turok-Han) Waiting to be picked off. Having nightmares about monsters 
    that can't be killed. But I don't believe in that. I always find a way. I'm 
    the thing that monsters have nightmares about. And right now, you and me are 
    gonna show 'em why. It's time. Welcome to Thunderdome.
  ANDREW
    Two men enter. One man leaves.
  The Turok-Han comes for Buffy. She's able to hold her own against it for 
    a moment, but soon she's being beaten back. The onlookers grimace as the Turok-Han 
    deals harsh blows to Buffy. Still, she manages to get in an offensive move 
    here and there, punching and kicking it between its own moves.
  DAWN
    (watching the fight, to Willow) This—you planned this. Letting the barrier 
    fail, bringing us here, you and Buffy.

    37a     INT.     DINING 
      ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
      The slayers-in-training are sitting around the dining room table. Buffy's 
      standing at the head of the table, and Willow's sitting at the other end 
      of the table.
    MOLLY
      Honestly, you staked that thing, and it didn't die.
    DAWN
      No, but that doesn't—
    VI
      Maybe it can't be killed.
    While the girls go on about this, Buffy's just staring straight ahead 
      with her arms crossed. 
    BUFFY (V.O.)
      (in an echoy voice, without moving her lips) Willow, can you hear me?
    WILLOW (V.O.)
      (looks at Buffy) Yeah.
    BUFFY (V.O.)
      We're losing them. We can't let that happen. I have an idea. Grab Xander.
    Buffy walks into the kitchen. Willow stands up to follow her, and walks 
      past Xander.
    WILLOW (V.O.)
      Xander.
    XANDER
      (jumps, stares at Willow) What?
    KENNEDY
      (to Xander) I said...
    XANDER
      I just thought it beared repeating. (leaves the room, follows Buffy and 
      Willow into the kitchen)
    Cut to:
    37b     INT.     KITCHEN 
      AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
      Buffy, Willow and Xander stand around looking at each other with stern and 
      concerned faces, communicating telepathically, while the girls bicker in 
      the other room.
    BUFFY (V.O.)
      I gotta slay the NeanderVamp to get Spike outta that cave, but I need those 
      girls to see me do it.
    WILLOW (V.O.)
      I get it, but this isn't the best venue for a smackdown.
    KENNEDY (O.S.)
      ...we can whine like little wusses, or we can get off our asses and fight...
    XANDER (V.O.)
      I know just the place.
  
  Cut to:
  Back at the construction site, Buffy is still fighting the Turok-Han. 
    It punches Buffy to the ground, but she gets back up to fight more. It throws 
    her about 20 feet away, and she lands on the scaffolds, knocking the crossbow 
    out of Kennedy's hands. Buffy picks up the weapon and aims it at the Turok-Han 
    and fires as it runs toward her, hitting it right in the heart. It only pauses 
    for a moment, then comes at her again. 
  Buffy grabs a nearby pipe from the scaffolding and uses it as a staff. 
    She then uses it to propel herself away from the fight, but the Turok-Han 
    is right behind her. She grabs a pickaxe and swings it at the Turok-Han, but 
    it ducks and pushes her into the wall of the construction office trailer. 
    Buffy falls to the ground, and the Turok-Han disarms her before throwing her 
    back toward the center of the open area. It punches her again and again. She 
    falls into a pile of cinder blocks, but picks one up to throw at the Turok-Han—but 
    it crushes it before she can throw it. It punches her again, and kicks her 
    under some scaffolding before throwing her a dozen feet into the air, through 
    the scaffold platform. Buffy manages to stay on the platform, and the Turok-Han 
    scales the scaffolding to get to her. He grabs her by the throat, lifting 
    her off the ground and choking her as she struggles against him.
  RONA
    It's killing her.
  MOLLY
    We have to do something.
  WILLOW
    Wait!
  Buffy reaches down, grabs the arrow in the Turok-Han's chest, pulls it 
    out, and jabs its eye. It roars and drops Buffy. While it's dealing with its 
    injury, Buffy starts punching it, and kicks it to the ground, where it lands 
    in a pile of cinder blocks and boards. Weakly, it tries to punch her back, 
    but she keeps punching and kicking it until finally she can bang its head 
    into the metal scaffolding. Buffy grabs some nearby barbed wire and slips 
    it around the Turok-Han's throat. It falls to the ground, and Buffy pulls 
    on it hard enough to sever its head. The Turok-Han explodes in a cloud of 
    dust in front of her. 
  BUFFY
    See? Dust. Just like the rest of 'em. I don't know what's coming next, but 
    I do know it's gonna be just like this. Hard. Painful. But in the end it's 
    gonna be us. If we all do our parts, believe it, we'll be the ones left standing. 
    Here endeth the lesson.
  Buffy walks away as the slayers-in-training watch her. Kennedy smiles; 
    the other girls look at each other. They all follow Buffy out of the construction 
    site. Pan back to show Eve/First standing on the scaffolding, scowling and 
    glaring as she watches them leave.
  Cut to:
  38     INT.     UNDERGROUND 
    CAVE - NIGHT
    Still shackled to the rocky cave wall, Spike sees someone walking toward him.
  SPIKE
    (scoffs) A knife, now, is it? 
  White-shirted, cut and bruised Buffy is standing before him holding a 
    Bringer's knife in her hand.
  SPIKE
    (weakly) What'll...what'll that...you—you can't hurt me. You're—you're 
    just a bloody figment, you are. You're just...
  Buffy approaches him slowly and cuts him loose of his tethers. He collapses 
    forward and braces himself with his hand on her shoulder. When he touches 
    her and realizes she's real, he smiles and squints, searching her face intently. 
    She looks into his eyes, tapping an emotional connection between them.
  SPIKE
    You. Oh. 
  He puts his arm over her shoulder, and she puts her arm around his waist. 
    Although Spike is weak and limping, they walk out of the cave together.
